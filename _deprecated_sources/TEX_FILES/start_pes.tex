\bAPI{START\_PES}{ Called at the beginning of an \openshmem program to
initialize the execution environment. (This routine is deprecated and is
provided for backwards compatibility. Implementations must include it, and the
routines should function properly while notifying the user about deprecation
of its use.)}

 %API description
 {   
     The \FUNC{start\_pes} routine initializes the \openshmem execution
     environment.  An \openshmem program must call
     \FUNC{start\_pes} before calling any other \openshmem routine.

 %Return Values     
\desR{ None. }
\notesB{ 
    If any other \openshmem call occurs before \FUNC{start\_pes}, the
    behavior is undefined.  Although it is recommended to set \VAR{npes} to
    \CONST{0} for \FUNC{start\_pes}, this is not mandated.  The value is ignored.
    Calling \FUNC{start\_pes} more than once has no subsequent
    effect.

% Notes. If there are no notes, this field can be left empty.
 \notesB{
    As of \openshmem Specification 1.2 the use of \FUNC{start\_pes} has
    been deprecated. Although \openshmem libraries are required to support the
    call, program users are encouraged to use \FUNC{shmem\_init} instead.
