%DESCRIPTION
%Arguments
\desB{
       \argRow{IN}{size}{The size, in bytes, of a block to be allocated from the symmetric heap. This argument is of type \VAR{size\_t}}
       \argRow{IN}{ptr}{Points to a block within the symmetric heap.}
       \argRow{IN}{alignment}{Byte alignment of the block allocated from the symmetric heap.}
}
%API Description
{
       The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} routine returns a pointer to a block of at least \VAR{size}
       bytes suitably aligned for any use.  This space is allocated from the
       symmetric heap (in contrast to \FUNC{malloc}, which allocates from the
       private heap).

       The \FUNC{shmem\_align} routine allocates a block in the symmetric heap that
       has a byte alignment specified by the alignment argument.

       The \FUNC{shmem\_free} routine causes the block to which \VAR{ptr} points to be
       deallocated, that is, made available for further allocation.  If \VAR{ptr} is
       a null pointer, no action occurs. 
              
       The \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} routine changes the size of the block to which \VAR{ptr}
       points to the size (in bytes) specified by \VAR{size}.  The contents of the
       block are unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old sizes. If the
       new size is larger, the value of the newly allocated portion of the
       block is indeterminate.  
       If \VAR{ptr} is a \CONST{NULL} pointer, the \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} routine behaves like the \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} routine for the specified size.  If \VAR{size} is \CONST{0} and \VAR{ptr} is not a \CONST{NULL} pointer, the block to which it points is freed. If the space cannot be allocated, the block to which \VAR{ptr} points is unchanged.

       The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}, \FUNC{shmem\_free}, and \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} routines are provided  so that multiple \ac{PE}s in a program can allocate symmetric, remotely
       accessible memory blocks.  These memory blocks can then be used with
       \openshmem communication routines.  Each of these routines call the
       \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} routine before returning; this ensures that all
       \ac{PE}s participate in the memory allocation, and that the memory on other
       \ac{PE}s can be used	as  soon as the local \ac{PE} returns.  The user is
       responsible for calling these routines with identical argument(s) on
       all \ac{PE}s; if differing \VAR{size} arguments are used, the behavior of the call and any subsequent \openshmem calls becomes undefined.
       %subsequent calls may not
       %return the same symmetric heap address on all \ac{PE}s.

		%Return Value
		\desR{
					 The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} routine returns a pointer to the allocated space; otherwise, it returns a \CONST{NULL} pointer.

					 The \FUNC{shmem\_free} routine returns no value.

					 The \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} routine returns a pointer to the allocated space (which may have moved); otherwise, it returns a null pointer.

                     The \FUNC{shmem\_align} routine returns an aligned pointer to the allocated space; otherwise, it returns a \CONST{NULL} pointer.

		%NOTES
		\notesB{ As of Specification 1.2 the use of \FUNC{shmalloc},
                \FUNC{shmemalign}, \FUNC{shfree},  and \FUNC{shrealloc} has been
                deprecated. Although OpenSHMEM libraries are required to support
                the calls, program users are encouraged to use
                \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}, \FUNC{shmem\_align}, \FUNC{shmem\_free},
                and \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} instead.  The behavior and signature
                of the routines remains unchanged from the deprecated versions.
				 
The total size of the symmetric heap is determined at job startup.  One can adjust the size of the heap using the \CONST{SMA\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE} environment  variable (where available).	

The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}, \FUNC{shmem\_free}, and \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} routines differ from the private heap allocation routines in that all \ac{PE}s in a program must call them (a barrier is used to ensure this).
        }		
        \notesImp{
        The symmetric heap allocation functions always return a pointer to
        corresponding symmetric objects across all PEs. The \openshmem{} 
        specification does not require that the virtual addresses are equal across
        all \acp{PE}. Nevertheless, the implementation must avoid costly address
        translation operations in the communication path, including order $N$ (where
        $N$ is the number of \acp{PE}) memory translation tables. 
        In order to avoid address translations, the implementation may
        re-map the allocated block of memory based on agreed virtual address. 
        Additionally, some operating systems provide an option to disable 
        virtual address randomization, which enables predictable allocation
        of virtual memory addresses.
