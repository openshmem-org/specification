%API description
{
  This routine returns the major and minor version of the \openshmem{} standard in use.
  For a given library implementation, the major and minor version returned by these calls is consistent with the compile-time constants, SHMEM\_MAJOR\_VERSION and SHMEM\_MINOR\_VERSION, defined in its shmem.h.
  The valid major version value is  $1$, and the valid minor version value is $2$.
