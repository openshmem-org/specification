%API description
 {
       SHPDEALLC returns a block of memory (allocated using \FUNC{SHPALLOC}) to the
       list of available space in the symmetric heap.  To maintain symmetric
       heap consistency, all \ac{PE}s in a program must call
       \FUNC{SHPDEALLC} with the same value of \VAR{addr}; if any \ac{PE}s  are missing, the program hangs.
