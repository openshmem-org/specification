%API description
 {     The \FUNC{SHPCLMOVE} routine either extends a symmetric heap block if the
       block is followed by a large enough free block or copies the contents
       of the existing block to a larger block and returns a status code
       indicating that the block was moved.  This routine also can reduce the
       size of a block if the new length is less than  the old length.  All
       \ac{PE}s  in a program must call \FUNC{SHPCLMOVE} with the
       same value of \VAR{addr} to maintain symmetric heap consistency; if any \ac{PE}s
       are missing, the program hangs.
