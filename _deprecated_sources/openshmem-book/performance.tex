\chapter{Programming with \openshmem for High Performance}

\section{Applications}

We talk about \openshmem on high-end systems, so we need to give some
examples and indicate what the important features of each is.

Describe best techniques for dragging good performance out of code.
E.g.\ tips on maximizing overlap, minimizing data motion,
understanding system layout.

\section{Library Implementations}

Also look at how to get good performance out of the library itself
on different platforms, not just applications written in \openshmem.

Could also talk about how hardware platforms influence design
decisions in \openshmem implementations and what you could do to
leverage things like communication offload.  We have examples of
Infiniband, Portals and intra-node.

And, of course, we should also talk about UCCS.
