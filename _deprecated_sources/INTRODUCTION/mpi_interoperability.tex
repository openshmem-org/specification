\section{\ac{MPI} Interoperability}
\begin{sloppypar} %SP: to prevent constants from running into margins.
\openshmem routines can be used in conjunction with \ac{MPI}
routines  in the same program.  For example, on SGI systems, programs that use both \ac{MPI} and \openshmem routines call \FUNC{MPI\_Init} and \FUNC{MPI\_Finalize} but omit the call to the \FUNC{shmem\_init} routine.  \openshmem \ac{PE} numbers are equal to the \ac{MPI} rank within the \CONST{MPI\_COMM\_WORLD} environment variable.  Note that this precludes use of \openshmem routines between processes in different \CONST{MPI\_COMM\_WORLD}s. 
\ac{MPI} processes started using the \FUNC{MPI\_Comm\_spawn} routine, for
example, cannot use \openshmem routines to communicate with their parent
\ac{MPI} processes.
\end{sloppypar}
On SGI systems where \ac{MPI} jobs use TCP/sockets for inter-host communication, \openshmem routines can be used to communicate with processes running on the same host.  The \FUNC{shmem\_pe\_accessible} routine can be used to determine if a remote \ac{PE} is accessible via \openshmem communication from the local \ac{PE}. When running an \ac{MPI} program involving multiple executable files, \openshmem routines can be used to communicate with processes running from the same or different executable files, provided that the communication is limited to symmetric data objects.  On these systems, static memory such as a \Fortran{} common block or \Clang{} global variable, is symmetric between processes running from the same executable file, but is not symmetric between processes running from different executable files.  Data allocated from the symmetric heap (\FUNC{shmem\_malloc} or \FUNC{shpalloc}) is symmetric across the same or different executable files. The routine \FUNC{shmem\_addr\_accessible} can be used to determine if a local address is accessible via \openshmem communication from a remote \ac{PE}.

 Another important feature of these systems is that the \FUNC{shmem\_pe\_accessible} routine returns \CONST{TRUE} only if the remote \ac{PE} is a process running from the same executable file as the local PE, indicating that full \openshmem support (static memory and symmetric heap) is available.  When using \openshmem routines within an \ac{MPI} program, the use of \ac{MPI} memory placement environment variables is required when using non-default memory placement options.
