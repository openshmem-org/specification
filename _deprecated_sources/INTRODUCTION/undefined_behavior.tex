The specification provides guidelines to the expected behavior of
various library routines.  In cases where routines are improperly used
or the input is not in accordance with the specification, undefined
behavior may be observed.  Depending on the implementation there are
many interpretations of undefined behavior.

\textbf{Inappropriate Usage} & \textbf{Undefined Behavior}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
Uninitialized library & If \openshmem is not initialized through a call to
\FUNC{shmem\_init}, subsequent accesses to \openshmem routines have undefined
results.  An implementation may choose, for example, to try to continue or abort
immediately upon the first call to an uninitialized routine.\tabularnewline
\hline 
Accessing non-existent \ac{PE}s & If a communications routine accesses a
non-existent \ac{PE}, then the \openshmem library can choose to handle this
situation in an implementation-defined way.  For example, the library may issue
an error message saying that the \ac{PE} accessed is outside the range of
accessible \ac{PE}s, or may exit without a warning.\tabularnewline
\hline 
Use of non-symmetric variables & Some routines require remotely accessible
variables to perform their function.  A \PUT{} to a non-symmetric variable can
be trapped where possible and the library can abort the program.  Another
implementation may choose to continue either with a warning or
silently.\tabularnewline
\hline 
Non-symmetric variables & The symmetric memory management routines are
collectives, which means that all \ac{PE}s in the program must issue the same
\FUNC{shmem\_malloc} call with the same size request.  Program behavior after a
mismatched \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} call is undefined.\tabularnewline
\hline 
Use of NULL pointers with non-zero \VAR{len} specified & In any \openshmem routine
that takes a pointer and \VAR{len} describing the number of elements in that
pointer, NULL may not be specified for the pointer unless the corresponding \VAR{len} is also
specified as zero. Otherwise, the resulting behavior is undefined.
The following cases summarize this behavior:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \VAR{len} is 0, pointer is NULL: supported.
    \item \VAR{len} is not 0, pointer is NULL: undefined behavior.
    \item \VAR{len} is 0, pointer is not NULL: supported.
    \item \VAR{len} is not 0, pointer is not NULL: supported.
\end{itemize}
\tabularnewline
\hline 
Multiple calls to \FUNC{shmem\_init} & In an OpenSHMEM program where
\FUNC{shmem\_init} has already be called, any subsequent calls to
\FUNC{shmem\_init} result in undefined behavior.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
