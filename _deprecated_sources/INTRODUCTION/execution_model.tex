%This comes from the UPC spec:
%The memory consistency model in a language defines the order in which the results of write operations may be observed through read operations.
%The behavior of a OpenSHMEM program may depend on the timing of accesses to symmetric variables on PEs, so in general a program defines a set of possible executions, 
%rather than a single execution. The memory consistency model constrains the set of possible executions for a given program; the user may then rely 
%on properties that are true of all of those executions.
    

\section{Execution Model}
%\openshmem  can use a single process multiple data (SPMD) or MIMD 
%parallelism.  An \openshmem application makes use of multiple processors,
%referred to as Processing Elements or PEs, to complete operations
%in parallel. 
Although \openshmem follows the SPMD execution model, different \ac{PE}s may have different execution paths and will execute asynchronously following \Fortran{} or program execution in \Clang.  Each \ac{PE} may be mapped to many to one hardware cores/threads or less. In \openshmem the number of \ac{PE}s is specified at runtime.

\openshmem requires initialization before using any of the \openshmem library
routines by calling \textbf{start\_pes()}.  %during the initialization phase of a program. %SP:repetitive.
The \ac{PE}s do not exist till after \FUNC{start\_pes} returns. \FUNC{start\_pes} performs any required initialization steps, such as setting up the symmetric heap for every \ac{PE} and creating and assigning \ac{PE} numbers which act like unique global identifiers for the duration of the program. These \ac{PE} identifiers are integers assigned in a monotonically increasing manner from zero to the total number of \ac{PE}s minus 1. \ac{PE} identifiers are used on \openshmem library calls (i.e. to access symmetric objects from specific \ac{PE}s, collective synchronization, etc.) or to dictate a definite control flow for \ac{PE}s using constructs of \Clang{} or \Fortran. Some collective routines require the creation of an \activeset, which is  group of \ac{PE}s that is involved in the execution of a collective routine. These collective routines assume that only \ac{PE}s in the \activeset{} call the routine. If a \ac{PE} not in the \activeset{} calls an \openshmem collective routine, undefined  behavior results.
An OpenSHMEM program consists of a set of processes, called \ac{PE}s where each process has its own 'local' (private) memory and symmetric memory regions that may be accessible by any \ac{PE}s.
Although \openshmem follows the \ac{SPMD} execution model, different \ac{PE}s may have different execution paths and will execute asynchronously following \Fortran{} or program execution in \Clang{} or \Cpp.  Each PE may be mapped to many to one hardware cores/threads or less. In \openshmem the number of \ac{PE}s is specified at runtime.

\openshmem collective routine, undefined  behavior results.

%The symmetric heap is one of the memory spaces
%that is remotely accessible by all PEs. The symmetric heap is discussed
%further in the Memory Model section. The PE numbers are the
%identifiers used to refer to each of the PEs involved in the execution.
%Consistent with the SPMD nature of the \openshmem programming model  is  the concept of symmetric data objects.  These are arrays or variables that exist with the same size,  type,	 and  relative	address	 on  all  PEs. Another	term  for  symmetric data objects is "remotely accessible data objects."  In the interface definitions for \openshmem data  transfer	 functions,  one or more of the parameters are typically required to be symmetric or remotely accessible. The following kinds of data objects are symmetric:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Fortran data objects in common blocks or with the  SAVE  attribute. These data objects	must not be defined in a dynamic shared object (DSO).
%  \item Non-stack C and C++ variables.   These  data	objects must  not  be defined in a DSO.
%  \item Fortran arrays allocated with \textit{shpalloc} 
%  \item C and C++ data allocated by \textit{shmalloc}
%\end{itemize}       
%
%Data transfer in \openshmem is possible through several one-sided put
%(for write) and get (for read) operations, as well as various collective
%routines such as broadcasts and reductions. Since the library provides the flexibility of one-sided operations the execution pattern is depends on the how the programmer decides to distribute work amongst different PEs and the synchronization and ordering operations used.
%
%Query routines are available to gather information about the execution.
%\openshmem also provides synchronization routines to coordinate data
%transfers and other operations. 
As of now, an \openshmem program finishes execution by returning from the main routine. 
It is up to the implementation on how to handle the finalization of the
\openshmem library and any other resources initialized by the library:
there is currently no explicit call defined in the \openshmem specification.


\subsection{Progress of \openshmem Routines}

The \openshmem model assumes that computation and communication are
naturally overlapped.  High quality \openshmem implementations must insure that programs exhibit %SP: Changing MUST to may as per discussion on 01/31/2014
progression of communication both with and without \openshmem calls.
Consider a \ac{PE} that is engaged in a long computation with no \openshmem calls.
Other \ac{PE}s must be able to communicate (put/get,
collective, atomic) with that computationally-bound \ac{PE} without that \ac{PE}
issuing any explicit \openshmem calls. \openshmem communication calls involving that \ac{PE} must progress
regardless of when that \ac{PE} next engages in an \openshmem call.

\textbf{Note to implementers:} progress will often be ensured through
the use of a dedicated progress thread in software, or through
network hardware that offloads communication handling from processors.

%\subsection{Using the Symmetric \VAR{Work} and \VAR{pSync} Arrays}

%Multiple \VAR{pSync} arrays are often needed if a particular \ac{PE} calls a \openshmem
%collective  function twice without intervening barrier synchronization.
%Problems would occur if some \ac{PE}s in the \activeset{} for call 2 arrive at
%call 2 before processing of call 1 is complete by all \ac{PE}s in the call 1
%\activeset.  You can use  \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}  or  \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}  to
%perform  a  barrier  synchronization between consecutive calls to \openshmem
%collective functions. There are two special cases:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} function allows the same \VAR{pSync} array to be used
%          on consecutive calls as long as the active \ac{PE} set does not change.
%\item  If the same collective function is called multiple times with the
%          same \activeset, the calls may alternate between two \VAR{pSync} arrays.
%          The \openshmem functions guarantee that a first call is completely finished by 
%          all \ac{PE}s by the time processing of a third  call  begins  on
%          any \ac{PE}.          
%\end{itemize}
%Because  the \openshmem functions restore \VAR{pSync} to its original contents,
%multiple calls that use the same \VAR{pSync} array do not require that \VAR{pSync}
%be reinitialized after the first call.

\subsection{Atomicity Guarantees}

\openshmem contains a number of routines that operate on symmetric data
atomically.  These routines guarantee that accesses by \openshmem's
atomic routines will be exclusive, but do not guarantee exclusivity
in combination with other routines, either inside \openshmem or
outside.

For example: during the execution of a remote integer increment
routine on a symmetric variable \VAR{x}, no other \openshmem atomic
routine may access \VAR{x}.  After the increment, \VAR{x} will have
increased its value by \CONST{1} on the target \ac{PE}, at which point other
atomic routines may then modify that \VAR{x}.

%  %Memory model
%    *Each OpenSHMEM PEs may have symmetric memory that is accessible by other PEs. 
%    *Symmetric memory is a region of memory where all the an instance of a data objects is replicated across PEs, have 
%     the same the same layout and relative offset.
%    *All PEs can allocate a symmetric data objects using the symmetric heap, but they must do so as a collective operation. (is there a barrier after shmalloc?)
%    *All writes to symmetric memory are relaxed (I'm not sure if this is the completion semantics) and are guaranteed to be visible to other PEs after a barrier_all, barrier(?), quiet, (what about wait? does it means iti sonly visible to me?) 
%    *Calls to barrier, barrier_all, quiet, wait, lock, atomics, are meant to guarantee memory consistency across PEs.
%    *Read/Writes to symmetric data object may appear after startpe or after a the symmetric data object has been allocated in the symmetric heap (if it is a dynamic).
%    *Operations like reduction, collect, etc guarantee memory consistency after completion(?)
%    *Data races are possible in OpenSHMEM if multiple PEs write/read a symmetric data object from a single PE without proper synchronization.
