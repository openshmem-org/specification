%\openshmem{} specification defines various \acp{AMO}.
\ac{AMO} is a one-sided communication mechanism that combines memory update operations with atomicity guarantees described in Section \ref{sec:amo_guarantees}. 
Similar to the \ac{RMA} routines, described in Section \ref{sec:rma},
the \acp{AMO} are performed only on symmetric objects. 
\openshmem{} defines the two types of \ac{AMO} routines:
\begin{itemize}
\item % Blocking\\
The \textit{fetch-and-operate} routines combine memory update and fetch 
operations in a single atomic operation.
The routines return after the data has been fetched and delivered to the local \ac{PE}.
%Fetch-and-operate operations are blocking atomic operation and return as
%soon as the fetched is delivered to the initiator of the operation.

The \textit{fetch-and-operate} operations include: \FUNC{SHMEM\_CSWAP}, \FUNC{SHMEM\_SWAP}, \FUNC{SHMEM\_FINC}, and\\ \FUNC{SHMEM\_FADD}.

\item % Non-Blocking\\
The \textit{non-fetch} atomic routines update the remote memory 
in a single atomic operation.
A \textit{non-fetch} atomic routine
starts the atomic operation and may return before the operation execution
on the remote \ac{PE}. 
To force completion for these \textit{non-fetch} atomic routines, \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}, 
\FUNC{shmem\_barrier}, or \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} can be used by an \openshmem{} program. 

The \textit{non-fetch} operations include: \FUNC{SHMEM\_INC} and \FUNC{SHMEM\_ADD}.
\end{itemize}
%Fetch-and-operate routines are described in Section \ref{sec:amo_fetch} and non-fetch routines 
%described in Section  \ref{sec:amo_nonfetch}.
%All atomic operations in \openshmem{} are blocking operations.
