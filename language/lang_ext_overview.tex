\openshmem provides ISO \Cstd bindings. \Cstd bindings are the primary language
bindings provided by \openshmem specification. Implementations can claim
conformance to the specification by just providing support for the primary \Cstd
bindings. In this document, other language bindings are introduced as extensions
to the \openshmem specification. Implementations can selectively provide support
for language bindings introduced in this document and may claim conformance only
with respect to those languages.
