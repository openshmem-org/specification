# OpenSHMEM Application Programming Interface

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the OpenSHMEM specification.

## Organization of the Repository

The current version of the OpenSHMEM specification is maintained in the ```master``` branch.  Each published version of the specification is marked with a tag of the format ```vX.Y``` where X and Y are the major and minor version numbers.  The in-progress development work of the next version of the OpenSHMEM specification is maintained in the ```osh_spec_next``` branch.

## Proposing Changes to the Specification

Changes should be proposed as pull requests against the ```osh_spec_next``` branch.  Text changes must be ratified through the OpenSHMEM specification committee.  All changes must pass CI testing and require two reviews before merging.
