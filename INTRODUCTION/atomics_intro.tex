%\openshmem{} specification defines various \acp{AMO}.
\ac{AMO} is a one-sided communication mechanism that compbines memory update operations with atomicity gurantees described in Section \ref{sec:amo_guarantees}. 
Similar to the \ac{RMA} routines, described in Section \ref{sec:rma},
the \acp{AMO} are performed only on the symmetric objects. 
\openshmem{} defines the two types of \ac{AMO} routines:
\begin{itemize}
\item % Blocking\\
The \textit{fetch-and-operate} routines combine memory update and fetch 
operations in a single atomic operation.
The routines return after the data has been fetched and delivered to the local PE.
%Fetch-and-operate operations are blocking atomic operation and return as
%soon as the fetched is delivered to the initiator of the operation.

The \textit{fetch-and-operate} operations include: \FUNC{SHMEM\_CSWAP}, \FUNC{SHMEM\_SWAP}, \FUNC{SHMEM\_FINC}, and\\ \FUNC{SHMEM\_FADD}.

\item % Non-Blocking\\
The \textit{non-fetch} atomic routines update the remote memory 
in a single atomic operations.
A \textit{non-fetch} atomic routine
starts the atomic operation and may return before the operation execution
on the remote PE.
The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} function is used to force completion of all \acp{AMO}.

The \textit{non-fetch} operating include: \FUNC{SHMEM\_INC} and \FUNC{SHMEM\_ADD}.
\end{itemize}
%Fetch-and-operate routines are described in Section \ref{sec:amo_fetch} and non-fetch routines 
%described in Section  \ref{sec:amo_nonfetch}.
%All atomic operations in \openshmem{} are blocking operations.
