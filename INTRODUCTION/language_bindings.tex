\section{Language Bindings and Conformance}

\openshmem is available with \Clang{} and \Fortran{} bindings.  The \Cpp{}
interface is currently the same as that for \Clang. An \openshmem implementation can be conformant to one or both of the
interfaces.  An implementation that provides e.g.\ only a \Clang{} interface may claim to conform to the \openshmem specification with respect to
the \Clang{} language, but not to \Fortran{} and should make this clear in its documentation. An implementation that provides both \Clang{} and \Fortran{} bindings may claim
complete conformance.
