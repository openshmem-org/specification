%Comments for Manju:
%Are Barrier_all, shmalloc, etc considered collectives? If yes, we need to state that all PEs belong to an implicit active set that contains all PES.
%Also describe the case where collective operations may be invoked by the implicit active set (all PEs) or active sets PEs
%State that collectives can be executed on statements that are not ordered .
%State that from the beginning to the end of the program, the sequence of collectives should be the same on a given active set (or implicit active set).
%Are arguments  the same for PEs that call the same collective? (i.e. target or source symmetric data?)
%Which collectives imply synchronization (i.e. barrier, quiet, etc) which ones not (i.e. broadcast on root?)

Collective operations are defined as communication or synchronization operations 
on a group of \ac{PE}s called \activeset{}. The collective operations require all
\ac{PE}s in the \activeset{} to simultaneously call the operation. 
A \ac{PE} that is not part of the \activeset{} calling the collective 
operations results in an undefined behavior.  All
collective operations have an \activeset{} as an input parameter except \barrierall{}. The \barrierall{} is called by all \ac{PE}s of the \openshmem{} program. 

The \activeset{} is defined by the arguments \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, 
and \VAR{PE\_size}.  \VAR{PE\_start} is the starting \ac{PE} number, a log (base 2) of \VAR{logPE\_stride} is the stride between \ac{PE}s, and \VAR{PE\_size} is the number of \ac{PE}s participating in the \activeset{}.  All \ac{PE}s participating in the 
collective operations provide the same values for these arguments. 
 
Another argument important to collective operations is \VAR{pSync}, which is a symmetric work array.  All \ac{PE}s participating in a collective must pass the same
\cbstart \VAR{pSync} \cbend array.  On completion of a collective call, the \VAR{pSync} is restored to its 
original contents.  The reuse of \VAR{pSync} array is allowed for a \ac{PE}, if all previous collective operations using the \VAR{pSync} array \cbstart have been \cbend completed by all participating 
\ac{PE}s.  One can use a synchronization collective operation such as \barrier{}
to ensure completion of previous collective operations. \cbstart The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} function allows the same \VAR{pSync} array to be used on consecutive calls as long as the active \ac{PE} set does not change. \cbend

%The two cases below
%show the reuse of \VAR{pSync} array:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} function allows the same \VAR{pSync} array to be used on consecutive calls as long as the active \ac{PE} set does not change.
%\item  If the same collective function is called multiple times with the
%          same \activeset, the calls may alternate between two \VAR{pSync} arrays.
%          The \openshmem functions guarantee that a first call is completely finished by 
%          all \ac{PE}s by the time processing of a third  call  begins  on any \ac{PE}.          
%\end{itemize}


All collective operations defined in the specification are blocking.  The 
collective operations return on completion.  The collective operations defined in the \openshmem{} specification 
are:

\begin{itemize}
\item[] \broadcast{} 
\item[] \barrier{}
\item[] \barrierall{}
\item[] \collect{}
\item[] \reduction{}
\end{itemize}
