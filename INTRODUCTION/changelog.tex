\section{Version 1.1}
This section summarizes the changes from the \openshmem specification Version 1.0 to the Version 1.1.  
A major change in this version is that it provides an accurate description of \openshmem interfaces so that they are in agreement with the SGI specification.  This version also explains \openshmemâ€™s programming, memory, and execution model.  The document was throughly changed to improve the readability of specification and usability of interfaces.  The code examples were added to demonstrate the usability of API. Additionally, diagrams were added to help understand the subtle semantic differences of various operations.

%This section summarizes the changes from the \openshmem specification version 1.0 to the version 1.1. 
%The major changes consist of more accurate descriptions of the \openshmem \acp{API} that 
%were part of the original SGI specification, but were omitted in version 1.0e. This new version also provides new
%diagrams that explain the correct behavior of \openshmem synchronization interfaces in terms of ordering, synchronization, delivery and
%completion of operations. Version 1.1 also does a better job at explaining the programming model, memory model and execution model  
%of \openshmem. 

The following list describes the specific changes in 1.1:%\rcomment{\\Eric: "better" is a subjective/ambiguous term, might need need a term to definitively describe how it is better.  i.e. is it more descriptive, more detailed, more accurate, easier to understand? etc.\\}
