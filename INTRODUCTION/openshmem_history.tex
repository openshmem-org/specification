\section*{History of \openshmem{}}
SHMEM has a long history as a parallel programming
model, having been used extensively on a number of products since
1993, including Cray T3D, Cray X1E, the Cray XT3/4, SGI Origin, SGI
Altix, clusters based on the Quadrics interconnect, and to a very
limited extent, Infiniband based clusters.

%Despite being supported by a variety of vendors there is no standard
%defining the SHMEM memory model or programming interface. Consistencies
%(where they exist) and extensions across the various implementations have
%been driven by the needs of an enthusiastic user community. The lack of a
%SHMEM standard has allowed each implementation to differ in both interface
%and semantics from vendor to vendor and even product line to product line,
%which has to this point limited broader acceptance.

%\begin{description}
%\item [{{Cray~SHMEM~(MP-SHMEM,~LC-SHMEM):}}] Cray first introduced
%SHMEM in 1993 for its Cray T3D systems. Cray SHMEM was also used in
%other models: T3E, PVP and XT series. 
%\item [{{SGI~SHMEM~(SGI-SHMEM):}}] Cray Research merged with Silicon
%Graphics (SGI) in February 1996. At this point SHMEM was incorporated
%into SGI's Message Passing Toolkit (MPT). The platforms supported
%were - SGI Irix, Origin and Altix. 
%\item [{{Quadrics~SHMEM~(Q-SHMEM):}}] an optimized API for the Quadrics
%QsNet interconnect. It included SGI extensions and provided non-blocking
%puts and gets. A joint effort from HCS Lab \& Quadrics incorporated
%a program profiling interface called PSHMEM that can aid in the execution
%analysis of SHMEM programs. 
%\end{description}
%The success of SHMEM's performance attracted several vendors to provide
%implementations (with varying names and features) for their systems.
%Some of them include: 
%\begin{description}
%\item [{{HP~SHMEM:}}] Based on the Quadrics API. It is included in the
%UPC product kit. 
%\item [{{Cyclops-64~SHMEM~(C64-SHMEM):}}] this SHMEM API supports the
%Cyclops-64 architecture. Most of the core features of Cray SHMEM are
%available with some additional interfaces specific to the Cyclops-64
%architecture. 
%
%\item [{{IBM~SHMEM:}}] An implementation created by IBM intended for
%internal use only. 
%\item [{{TurboSHMEM:}}] This implementation uses IBM's Low-Level API
%(LAPI) technology to obtain optimized one-sided communication for
%the put/get operations. This allows applications written with the
%SHMEM API to run on IBM platforms with minimal source code changes. 
%\item [{{GPSHMEM:}}] This implementation of SHMEM aims at providing full
%portability of applications. It is built mostly with Cray T3D components
%and functionalities and provides MPI and ARMCI support. This project
%is no longer maintained.
