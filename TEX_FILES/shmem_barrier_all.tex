%API description
{   
    The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} function registers the arrival of a \ac{PE} at a
    barrier. Barriers are a fast mechanism for synchronizing all \ac{PE}s at
    once. This routine causes a \ac{PE} to suspend execution until all \ac{PE}s have
    called \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}. This function must be used with \ac{PE}s started
    by \FUNC{start\_pes}.

    Prior to synchronizing with other \ac{PE}s, \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} ensures
    completion of all previously issued memory stores and remote
    memory updates issued via \openshmem{} \acp{AMO} and \ac{RMA} routine calls such as
    \FUNC{shmem\_int\_add} and \FUNC{shmem\_put32}.

% API Description
% 
%        The  shmem_barrier_all  function	 registers  the	 arrival  of a PE at a
%        barrier.	 Barriers are a fast mechanism for synchronizing  all  PEs  at
%        once.  This routine causes a PE to suspend execution until all PEs have
%        called shmem_barrier_all.  This function must be used with PEs  started
%        by start_pes().
% 
%        Prior  to  synchronizing	 with  other  PEs,  shmem_barrier_all  ensures
%        completion of all previously issued  local  memory  stores  and	remote
%        memory	updates	 issued	 via  shared  memory  routine  calls  such  as
%        shmem_put32().

% Return Value
%        None.
