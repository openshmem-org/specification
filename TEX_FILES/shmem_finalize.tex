 	None.

%API Description
{
       \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} guarantees all pending communication is completed and  \openshmem library specific resources are released before the call returns. \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} is a collective operation which requires all \acp{PE} to participate in the call and it may be called only once before the program returns from main. All process/threads that represent the PEs will still exist but may not participate in any  \openshmem operation. If any  \openshmem library call is encountered after  \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}, its behavior is undefined.

		%NOTES
		\notesB{
					The calling of \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} is optional. \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} has an implicit \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} for the completion of all outstanding \openshmem communication operations. \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} releases resources used by the OpenSHMEM library including the symmetric memory heap and pointers initiated by \FUNC{shmem\_ptr}.
