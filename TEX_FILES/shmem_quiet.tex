%API description
 { 
 The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine ensures completion of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store operations on symmetric data issued by the calling \ac{PE}. All \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, \cbstart memory \cbend store operations to symmetric data objects are guaranteed to be completed and visible to all \ac{PE}s when \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} returns. 
 %This also applies to all store operations to symmetric data issued by the calling \ac{PE}.  
 %SP: Removing confusing parts as according to SGI they are complete at the end of quiet.
 %no later than any subsequent memory load or 
 %store, \PUT{}  or  \GET{}, \acp{AMO},  or synchronization operations that follow the call to \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}.

\notesB{ 
       \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is most useful as a way of ensuring completion of
       several \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store operations to symmetric data objects initiated by the calling \ac{PE}.  For example, you might use \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} to await delivery of a block of data before issuing  another \PUT{}, which sets a completion flag on another \ac{PE}.

       \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} is not usually needed if \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}  or
        \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} are called.  The barrier routines  wait for the
       completion of outstanding writes (\PUT{}, \ac{AMO}, memory stores) to symmetric data objects on all \acp{PE}.
