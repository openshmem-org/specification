%DESCRIPTION
\cbend%Arguments
\desB{
       \argRow{IN}{size}{In bytes, to request a block to be allocated from the symmetric heap. This argument is of type \VAR{size\_t}}
    \cbstart   \argRow{IN}{ptr}{Points to a block within the symmetric heap.} \cbend
       \argRow{IN}{alignment}{Byte alignment of the block allocated from the symmetric heap.}
}
%API Description
{
       The \FUNC{shmalloc} \cbstart and \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}  functions return \cbend a pointer to a block of at least size
       bytes suitably aligned for any use.  This space is allocated from the
       symmetric heap (in contrast to \FUNC{malloc}, which allocates from the
       private heap).

       The  \FUNC{shmemalign} \cbstart and \FUNC{shmem\_align} functions allocate \cbend a block in the symmetric heap that
       has a byte \cbstart alignment \cbend specified by the alignment argument.

       The \FUNC{shfree} \cbstart and \FUNC{shmem\_free} functions cause \cbend the block to which \VAR{ptr} points to be
       deallocated, that is, made available for further allocation.  If ptr is
       a null pointer, no action occurs. 
              
       The  \FUNC{shrealloc} \cbstart and  \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} functions change \cbend the size of the block to which ptr
       points to the size (in bytes) specified by size.  The contents of the
       block are unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old sizes. If the
       new size is larger, the value of the newly allocated portion of the
       block is indeterminate.  
       If \VAR{ptr} is a \CONST{NULL} pointer, the \cbstart \FUNC{shrealloc}/\FUNC{shmem\_realloc} \cbend function behaves like the \cbstart \FUNC{shmalloc}/\FUNC{shmem\_malloc} \cbend function for the specified size.  If size  is \CONST{0} and ptr is not a \CONST{NULL} pointer, the block to which it points is freed. If the space cannot be allocated, the block to which ptr points is unchanged.

       The \FUNC{shmalloc}, \FUNC{shfree}, and \FUNC{shrealloc} functions are provided  so that multiple \ac{PE}s in an application can allocate symmetric, remotely
       accessible memory blocks.  These memory blocks can then be used with
       \openshmem communication routines.  Each of these functions call the
       \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} function before returning; this ensures that all
       \ac{PE}s participate in the memory allocation, and that the memory on other
       \ac{PE}s can be used	as  soon as the local \ac{PE} returns.  The user is
       responsible for calling these functions with identical argument(s) on
       all \ac{PE}s; if differing size arguments are used, the behavior of the call and any subsequent \openshmem calls becomes undefined.
       %subsequent calls may not
       %return the same symmetric heap address on all \ac{PE}s.

%API Description Table
{
		%Return Value
		\desR{
					 The \FUNC{shmalloc} function returns a pointer to the allocated space (which should be identical on all \ac{PE}s); otherwise, it returns a \CONST{NULL} pointer.

					 The \FUNC{shfree} function returns no value.

					 The \FUNC{shrealloc} function returns a pointer to the allocated space (which may have moved); otherwise, it returns a null pointer.
		}
		%NOTES
		\notesB{ \cbstart As of Specification 1.2 the use of \FUNC{shmalloc}, \FUNC{shmemalign}, \FUNC{shfree},  and \FUNC{shrealloc} has been deprecated. Although OpenSHMEM libraries are required to support the calls, application developers are encouraged to use \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}, \FUNC{shmem\_align}, \FUNC{shmem\_free}, and  \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} instead. \cbend
					 
The total size of the symmetric heap is determined at job startup.  One can adjust the size of the heap using the \CONST{SMA\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE} environment  variable (where available).	

The \cbstart \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}, \FUNC{shmem\_free}, and \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} functions differ from the private heap allocation functions in that all \ac{PE}s in an application must call them (a barrier is used to ensure this). \cbend
