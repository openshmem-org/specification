       Returns a memory block to the symmetric heap.

SYNOPSIS
       POINTER (addr, A(1))
       INTEGER errcode, abort
       CALL SHPDEALLC(addr, errcode, abort)

DESCRIPTION

Arguments

       IN	addr	      First word address of the block to deallocate.
       OUT	errcode	      Error  code is 0 if no error was detected; otherwise, it
		      is a  negative  integer  code  for  the  type  of	 error.
       IN	abort	      Abort code.  Nonzero requests abort on error; 0 requests
		      an error code.

API Description

       SHPDEALLC  returns  a block of memory (allocated using SHPALLOC) to the
       list of available space in the symmetric heap.  To  maintain  symmetric
       heap  consistency, all processing elements (PEs) in a program must call
       SHPDEALLC with the same value of addr; if  any  PEs  are	 missing,  the
       program hangs.


Return Value

       Error conditions are as follows:

       Code	      Condition
       -3	      Address is outside the bounds of the symmetric heap.
       -4	      Block is already free.
       -5	      Address is not at the beginning of the block.
