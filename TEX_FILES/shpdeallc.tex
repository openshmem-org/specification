%API description
 {
       SHPDEALLC  returns  a block of memory (allocated using SHPALLOC) to the
       list of available space in the symmetric heap.  To  maintain  symmetric
       heap  consistency, all \ac{PE}s in a program must call
       SHPDEALLC with the same value of addr; if  any  \ac{PE}s  are	 missing,  the
       program hangs.

\cRow{Error Code} {Condition}
\cRow{ -1 } {Length is not an integer greater than 0}
\cRow{-2} { No more memory is available from the system (checked  if the  request  cannot  be	satisfied from the available blocks on the symmetric heap).}
\cRow{-3}{	 Address is outside the bounds of the symmetric heap.}
