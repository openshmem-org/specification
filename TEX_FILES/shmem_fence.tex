%API description
{
    This  function ensures ordering of put (remote write) operations. All
    put operations issued to a particular remote  \ac{PE}
    prior  to the call to \FUNC{shmem\_fence} are guaranteed to be delivered before
    any subsequent put operations to the same \ac{PE} which follow the  call  to
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence}.

    The  \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} function  should  be  called  if  ordering of puts is
    desired when multiple remote \ac{PE}s are involved.
