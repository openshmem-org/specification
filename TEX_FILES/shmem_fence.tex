%API description
{
This function assures ordering of delivery of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store operations to symmetric data objects.
%This  function ensures ordering of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO} and store operations on symmetric data objects. 
All \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store operations to symmetric data objects issued to a particular remote \ac{PE} prior to the call to \FUNC{shmem\_fence} are guaranteed to be \cbstart delivered before any subsequent \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store operations to symmetric data objects to the same \ac{PE}. \FUNC{shmem\_fence} guarantees order of delivery not completion. \cbend
% which follow the  call  to
% \FUNC{shmem\_fence}.

\notesB{
 \FUNC{shmem\_fence} only provides per-\ac{PE} ordering guarantees and does not guarantee completion of delivery.  There is a subtle difference between  \FUNC{shmem\_fence} and \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}, \cbstart in that, \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} guarantees completion of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store operations to symmetric data objects which makes the updates visible to all other \acp{PE}. \cbend
 
 The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} function should be called if completion of PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store operations to symmetric data objects is desired when multiple remote \ac{PE}s are involved.
