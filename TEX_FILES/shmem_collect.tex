\OSH{} \cbstart \FUNC{collect} and \FUNC{fcollect} \cbend routines concatenate
\VAR{nelems} \CONST{64}-bit or \CONST{32}-bit data items from the \source{} array into the \target{} array, over the set of \ac{PE}s defined by \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{log2PE\_stride}, and \VAR{PE\_size}, in processor number order. The resultant \target{} array
contains the contribution from \ac{PE} \VAR{PE\_start} first, then the contribution
from \ac{PE} \VAR{PE\_start} + \VAR{PE\_stride} second, and so on. The collected result is written to the \target{} array for all \ac{PE}s in the \activeset.

The \FUNC{fcollect} routines require that \VAR{nelems} be the same value in all
participating \ac{PE}s, while the collect routines allow \VAR{nelems} to vary from
\ac{PE} to \ac{PE}.

As with all \openshmem collective routines, each of these routines assumes
that only \ac{PE}s in the \activeset{} call the routine. If a \ac{PE} not in the
\activeset{} calls \cbstart an \cbend \openshmem collective routine, undefined behavior
results.

The values of arguments \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and \VAR{PE\_size} must be equal on all \ac{PE}s in the \activeset. The same \target{} and \source{} arrays
and the same \VAR{pSync} work array must be passed to all \ac{PE}s in the \activeset.

Upon return from a collective routine, the following are true for the
local \ac{PE}: The \target{} array is updated. The values in the \VAR{pSync} array
are restored to the original values.

% Notes. If there are no notes, this field can be left empty.
\notesB{
All \openshmem collective routines reset the values in \VAR{pSync} before they
return, so a particular \VAR{pSync} buffer need only be initialized the first
time it is used.

You  must ensure that the \VAR{pSync} array is not being updated on any \ac{PE} in
the \activeset{} while any of the \ac{PE}s participate in processing of \cbstart an \cbend
\openshmem collective routine.  Be careful to avoid these situations: If the
\VAR{pSync} array is initialized at run time, some type of synchronization is
needed to ensure that all \ac{PE}s in the working set have initialized \VAR{pSync}
before any of them  enter \cbstart an \cbend \openshmem routine called with the \VAR{pSync}
synchronization array.  A \VAR{pSync} array can be reused on a subsequent
\openshmem collective routine only if none of the \ac{PE}s in the \activeset{}  are
still processing a  prior \openshmem collective routine call that used the
same \VAR{pSync} array.  In general, this may be ensured only by doing some
type of synchronization\cbstart .\cbend  
%However, in the special case of \openshmem
%routines being called with the same \activeset, you can allocate two
%\VAR{pSync} arrays and alternate between them on successive calls.

The collective routines operate on active \ac{PE} sets that have a
non-power-of-two \VAR{PE\_size} with some performance degradation.  They
operate with no performance degradation when \VAR{nelems} is a
non-power-of-two value.

% 		    permissible for the target argument.
% 
%        IN	nelems	    The number of elements in the source array.	 nelems must be
% 		    of	type  integer.	If you are using Fortran, it must be a

% 
%        IN	PE_start	    The lowest virtual PE number of the	 active	 set  of  PEs.

% API Description
% 
%        OpenSHMEM collect  and  fcollect	 routines  concatenate
%        nelems  64-bit or  32-bit data items from the source array into the target
%        array, over the set of PEs  defined  by	PE_start,  log2PE_stride,  and
%        PE_size,	 in  processor	number	order.	 The  resultant	 target	 array
%        contains the contribution from PE PE_start first, then the contribution
%        from  PE	 PE_start + PE_stride second, and so on.  The collected result
%        is written to the target array for all PEs in the active set.
% 
%        The fcollect routines require that nelems	 be  the  same	value  in  all
%        participating  PEs, while the collect routines allow nelems to vary from
%        PE to PE.
% 
%        As  with	 all OpenSHMEM collective routines, each of these routines assumes
%        that only PEs in the active set call the routine.  If a PE not  in  the
%        active  set  calls  a  OpenSHMEM  collective	 routine,  undefined  behavior
%        results.
% 
%        The values of arguments PE_start, logPE_stride,	and  PE_size  must  be
%        equal  on all PEs in the active set.  The same target and source arrays
%        and the same pSync work array must be passed to all PEs in  the	active
%        set.
% 
%        Upon  return  from a collective routine, the following are true for the
%        local PE: The target array is updated.  The values in the  pSync	 array
%        are restored to the original values.
% 
% Return Value
% 
% 	None.
% 
% NOTES
% 
%        All  OpenSHMEM  collective  routines	 reset the values in pSync before they
%        return, so a particular pSync buffer need only be initialized the first
%        time it is used.
