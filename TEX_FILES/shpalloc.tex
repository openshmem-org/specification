 %API description
 {   
       \FUNC{SHPALLOC} allocates a block of memory from the program's symmetric heap
       that is greater than or equal to the size requested. To maintain symmetric heap 
       consistency, all \ac{PE}s in an program must call \FUNC{SHPALLOC} with the same value of length; if any  \ac{PE}s are missing, the program will hang.
       
       By using the \Fortran{} \CONST{POINTER} mechanism in the following manner, you can use array \VAR{A} to refer to the block allocated by \FUNC{SHPALLOC}: \CONST{POINTER} (\VAR{addr},
       \VAR{A}())

 %Return Values     
\desR{ }
\cRow{Error Code} {Condition}
\cRow{ \CONST{-1} } {Length is not an integer greater than \CONST{0}}
\cRow{\CONST{-2}} { No more memory is available from the system (checked if the  request cannot be satisfied from the available blocks on the symmetric heap).}
}%end of DesR
\notesB{  
       The total size of the symmetric heap is determined at job startup.  One
       may adjust the size of the heap using the \CONST{SMA\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE}
       environment variable (if available).
