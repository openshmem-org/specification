%API description
{   
\openshmem broadcast routines are collective routines.
They copy data object \source{} on the processor specified by \VAR{PE\_root} and
store the values at \target{} on the other \ac{PE}s specified by the triplet
\VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, \VAR{PE\_size}.  The data is not copied to the \target{} area on the root \ac{PE}.

As with all \openshmem collective routines, each of these routines assumes
that only \ac{PE}s in the \activeset{} call the routine.  If a \ac{PE} not in the
\activeset{} calls an \openshmem collective routine, undefined behavior
results.

The values of arguments \VAR{PE\_root}, \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and \VAR{PE\_size} must be equal on all \ac{PE}s in the \activeset.  The same \target{} and \source{} data objects and the same \VAR{pSync} work array must be passed to all \ac{PE}s in the \activeset.

Before any \ac{PE} calls a broadcast routine, you must ensure that the
following conditions exist (synchronization via a barrier or some other
method is often needed to ensure this): The \VAR{pSync} array on all \ac{PE}s in
the \activeset{} is not still in use from a prior call to a broadcast
routine.  The \target{} array on all \ac{PE}s in the \activeset{} is ready to
accept the broadcast data.

Upon return from a broadcast routine, the following are true for the
local \ac{PE}: If the current \ac{PE} is not the root \ac{PE}, the \target{} data object
is updated.  The values in the \VAR{pSync} array are restored to the original
values.

       Multiple calls to \openshmem routines that use the same \VAR{pSync} array do not

       You must ensure the that the \VAR{pSync} array is not being updated by any \ac{PE}
       in the \activeset{} while any of the \ac{PE}s participates in processing of an
       \openshmem broadcast routine. Be careful to avoid these situations: If the
       \VAR{pSync} array is initialized at run time, some type of synchronization is
       needed to ensure that all \ac{PE}s in the working set have initialized \VAR{pSync}
       before any of them enter an \openshmem routine called with the \VAR{pSync}
       synchronization array.  A \VAR{pSync} array may be reused on a subsequent
       \openshmem broadcast routine only if none of the \ac{PE}s in the \activeset{} are
       still processing a prior \openshmem broadcast routine call that used the
       same \VAR{pSync} array.  In general, this can be ensured only by doing some
       type of synchronization.

% API Description
% 
%        OpenSHMEM broadcast routines are collective routines.
%        They copy data object source on the processor specified by PE_root  and

%        area on the root PE.
% 
%        As  with	 all OpenSHMEM collective routines, each of these routines assumes
%        that only PEs in the active set call the routine.  If a PE not  in  the
%        active  set  calls  a  OpenSHMEM  collective	 routine,  undefined  behavior
%        results.
% 
%        The  values  of	arguments PE_root, PE_start, logPE_stride, and PE_size
%        must be equal on all PEs in the active set.  The same target and source
%        data objects and the same pSync work array must be passed to all PEs in
%        the active set.
% 
%        Before any PE calls a broadcast	routine,  you  must  ensure  that  the
%        following conditions exist (synchronization via a barrier or some other
%        method is often needed to ensure this): The pSync array on all  PEs  in

%        routine.	 The target array on all PEs in the active  set	 is  ready  to
%        accept the broadcast data.
% 
%        Upon  return  from  a broadcast routine, the following are true for the
%        local PE: If the current PE is not the root PE, the target data	object
%        is updated.  The values in the pSync array are restored to the original
%        values.

% Return Value
%        
% 	None.
% 
% NOTES
% 
%        All OpenSHMEM broadcast routines restore pSync to  its  original  contents.
%        Multiple	 calls	to OpenSHMEM routines that use the same pSync array do not
%        require that pSync be reinitialized after the first call.
