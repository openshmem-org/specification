% DESCRIPTION
% 
% Arguments
% 
% 
%        OUT	target	 The  remotely accessible integer data object to be updated on
% 		 the remote PE.	 If you are using  C/C++,  the	data  type  of
% 		 target should match that implied in the SYNOPSIS section.  If
% 		 you are using Fortran, it must be of the following type:

% 		 Routine	       Data Type
% 
% 		 SHMEM_INT4_CSWAP      4-byte integer
% 
% 		 SHMEM_INT8_CSWAP      8-byte integer
% 
%        IN	cond	 cond is compared to the remote target value.  If cond and the
% 		 remote	 target	 are  equal,  then  value  is swapped into the
% 		 remote target.	 Otherwise, the remote	target	is  unchanged.
% 		 In  either  case,  the	 old  value  of	 the  remote target is
% 		 returned as the function return value.	 cond must be  of  the
% 		 same data type as target.
% 
%        IN	value	 The  value  to be atomically written to the remote PE.	 value
% 		 must be the same data type as target.
% 
%        IN	pe	 An integer that indicates the PE number upon which target  is
% 		 to  be	 updated.   If	you  are  using	 Fortran, it must be a
% 		 default integer value.
% API Description
% 
%        The conditional swap routines conditionally update a target data object
%        on  an  arbitrary processing element (PE) and return the prior contents
%        of the data object in one  atomic  operation.   
% 
% Return Value
% 
%        The contents that had been in the target data object on the  remote  PE
%        prior to the conditional swap. Data type is the same as the target data type.
%

% NOTES
% 
% 
% EXAMPLES
% 
%        The   following	call  ensures  that  the  first	 PE  to	 exectute  the
%        conditional swap will successfully write its PE number  to  race_winner
%        on PE 0.
