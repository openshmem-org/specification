\apidescription{   
     The \FUNC{start\_pes} routine initializes the \openshmem execution
     environment.  An \openshmem program must call either \FUNC{start\_pes} or
     \FUNC{shmem\_init} before calling any other \openshmem routine.  Unlike
     \FUNC{shmem\_init}, \FUNC{start\_pes} does not require a call to
     \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}.  Instead, the \openshmem library is implicitly
     finalized when the program exits.  Implicit finalization is collective and
     includes a global synchronization to ensure that all pending communication
     is completed before resources are released.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    If any other \openshmem call occurs before \FUNC{start\_pes}, the
    behavior is undefined.  Although it is recommended to set \VAR{npes} to
    \CONST{0} for \FUNC{start\_pes}, this is not mandated.  The value is ignored.
    Calling \FUNC{start\_pes} more than once has no subsequent
    effect.

    As of \openshmem Specification 1.2 the use of \FUNC{start\_pes} has
    been deprecated. Although \openshmem libraries are required to support the
    call, program users are encouraged to use \FUNC{shmem\_init} instead.
