The \openshmem specification provides a set of environment variables that allows
users to configure the \openshmem implementation, and receive information about
the implementation. The implementations of the specification are free to define
additional variables. Currently, the specification defines four environment
variables. All environment variables that start with \VAR{SMA\_*} are
deprecated, but currently supported for backwards compatibility.
