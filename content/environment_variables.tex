\TableIndex{Environment Variables}

The \openshmem specification provides a set of environment variables that allows
users to configure the \openshmem implementation, and receive information about
the implementation. The implementations of the specification are free to define
additional variables. Currently, the specification defines four environment
variables. All environment variables that start with \VAR{SMA\_*} are
deprecated, but currently supported for backwards compatibility.
If both \VAR{SHMEM\_}- and \VAR{SMA\_}-prefixed environment variables
are set, then the value in the \VAR{SHMEM\_}-prefixed environment variable
establishes the controlling value. Refer to the
\hyperref[subsec:deprecate-sma-env]{\VAR{SMA\_*} Environment Variables}
deprecation rationale for more details.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description}
\tabularnewline\hline
%%
\EnvVarDecl{SHMEM\_VERSION}
    & Any
    & Print the library version at start-up
    \tabularnewline\hline
%%
\EnvVarDecl{SHMEM\_INFO}
    & Any
    & Print helpful text about all these environment variables
    \tabularnewline\hline
%%
\EnvVarDecl{SHMEM\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE}
    & Non-negative integer
    & Controls the size of the symmetric heap per PE. The value 
      set in this environment variable is interpreted as number 
      of bytes, unless the number is followed by a char that 
      acts as a multiplier, where:
        g or G multiplies by 2**30 (gigabytes)
        k or K multiplies by 2**10 (kilobytes)
        m or M multiplies by 2**20 (megabytes)
      For example, the string 20m returns the integer value 20*2**20, 
      or 20 megabytes. Only one multiplier is recognized, so 20kk 
      will not produce the same value as 20m, nor will invalid 
      strings such as 20MB produce the desired result.
    \tabularnewline\hline
%%
\EnvVarDecl{SHMEM\_DEBUG}
    & Any
    & Enable debugging messages
