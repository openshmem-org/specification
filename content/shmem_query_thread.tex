\apidescription{
The \FUNC{shmem\_query\_thread} call returns the level of thread support
currently being provided. The value returned will be same as was returned in \VAR{provided}
by a call to \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread}, if the \openshmem library was
initialized by \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread}. If the library was initialized by
\FUNC{shmem\_init}, the implementation can choose to provide any one of the defined
thread levels, and \FUNC{shmem\_query\_thread} returns this thread level.
