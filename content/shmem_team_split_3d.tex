\apidescription{
The shmemx\_team\_split\_3d routine is a collective routine. It
partitions an existing parent team into three subgroups, based on the
three-dimensional Cartesian space defined by the triplet (xrange,
yrange, and zrange) describing the size of the Cartesian space in X,
Y, and Z dimensions. Each subgroup contains all \acp{PE} that are in the same
dimension, along the X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis. Within each subgroup,
the \acp{PE} are ranked based on the position of the \ac{PE} with respect to its
dimension in three-dimensional Cartesian space.

Any valid \ac{PE} team can be used as the parent team. This routine must be
called by all \acp{PE} in the parent team. The value of the triplets must be
non-negative, and the size of the parent team should be greater than or
equal to the size of the three-dimensional Cartesian space. None of the
parameters need to reside in symmetric memory.

Error checking will be done to ensure a valid team handle is provided.
All errors are considered fatal and will result in the job aborting with
an informative error message.
