The explicit non-blocking \ac{RMA} routines described in this section are
one-sided communication mechanisms similar to the \ac{RMA} routines
described in Section~\ref{sec:rma}. Most of the semantics for these
routines are the same as for regular \ac{RMA} routines.

All explicit non-blocking \ac{RMA} routines take a request object as a
parameter. The request object is used to track the status of the \ac{RMA}
operation. A request object can be used for multiple operations. If a
request object is used for multiple communication operations, the
resources assigned to the request can be shared.

This section describes the explicit non-blocking \ac{RMA}
routines and the routines used to track the \ac{RMA} routines.
Additionally, management routines are specified.
