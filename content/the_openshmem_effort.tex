\openshmem is a \ac{PGAS} library interface specification. \openshmem 
aims to provide a standard \ac{API} for SHMEM libraries to aid portability and
facilitate uniform predictable results of \openshmem programs by explicitly
stating the behavior and semantics of the \openshmem library calls. Through the
different versions, \openshmem will continue to address the requirements of the
\ac{PGAS} community.  As of this specification, existing vendors are moving
towards \openshmem compliant implementations and new vendors are developing
\openshmem library implementations to help the users write portable \openshmem
code. This ensures that programs can run on multiple platforms without having to
deal with subtle vendor-specific implementation differences. For more details on
the history of \openshmem please refer to the
\hyperref[sec:openshmem_history]{History of \openshmem} section.  

The \openshmem\footnote{The \openshmem specification is owned by Open Source
Software Solutions Inc., a non-profit organization, under an agreement with
SGI.}  effort is driven by the \ac{ESSC} at \ac{ORNL} and the University of
Houston with significant input from the \openshmem community. Besides the
specification, the effort also includes providing a reference \openshmem
implementation, validation and verification suites, tools, a mailing list and
website infrastructure to support specification activities. For more information
