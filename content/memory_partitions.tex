\emph{Symmetric Heaps} can be created on a single memory location determined by
the implementation or on multiple memory locations determined by the users. The
user-determined memory locations are called as the \emph{Symmetric Memory
Partitions}. Each Symmetric Memory Partitions are identified using their
\emph{Partition ID}, which are used on dynamic OpenSHMEM memory allocation 
(\textit{shmem\_kind\_malloc} and \textit{shmem\_kind\_align}) routines. Apart
from the Partition ID, each Symmetric Memory Partitions have their own memory
properties. On systems supporting heterogeneous memory, each memory kind can be
considered as one of the properties of the partition. Refer to Section
\ref{subsec:environment_variables} for the complete list of properties which
are available to define a memory partition.
