\openshmem provides ISO \Clang{} and \Fortran{} \textit{90} language bindings.
Any implementation that provides both \Clang{} and \Fortran{} bindings can claim
conformance to the specification. An implementation that provides e.g.\ only a
\Clang{} interface may claim to conform to the \openshmem specification with
respect to the \Clang{} language, but not to \Fortran, and should make this
clear in its documentation. The \openshmem header files for \Clang{} and
\Fortran{} must contain only the interfaces and constant names defined in this
specification.

\openshmem \ac{API}s can be implemented as either routines or macros. However,
implementing the interfaces using macros is strongly discouraged as this could
severely limit the use of external profiling tools and high-level compiler
optimizations. An \openshmem program should avoid defining routine names,
variables, or identifiers with the prefix \shmemprefix (for \Clang{} and
\Fortran), \shmemprefixC (for \Clang) or with \openshmem \ac{API} names.

All \openshmem extension \ac{API}s that are not part of this specification must
be defined in the \FUNC{shmemx.h} include file. These extensions shall use the
\FUNC{shmemx\_} prefix for all routine, variable, and constant names.
The existence of the \FUNC{shmemx.h} header is optional, but indicated through
a compile-time constant (Section~\ref{subsec:library_constants}).
