\begin{apiarguments}
    \apiargument{IN}{size}{The size, in bytes, of a block to be

\apidescription{

    The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc\_with\_hints} routine, like \FUNC{shmem\_malloc},
    is a collective operation on the world team that returns a pointer to a block of at least
    \VAR{size} bytes, which shall be suitably aligned so that it may be
    assigned to a pointer to any type of object.  This space is allocated from
    the symmetric heap (similar to \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}).  When the \VAR{size} is zero,
    the \FUNC{shmem\_malloc\_with\_hints} routine performs no action and returns a null pointer.

    In addition to the \VAR{size} argument, the \VAR{hints} argument is provided by the user.
    The \VAR{hints} describes the expected manner in which the \openshmem program may use the allocated memory.
    The valid usage of hints are described in Table~\ref{usagehints}. Multiple hints may be requested by combining them with a bitwise \CONST{OR} operation.
    A zero option can be given if no options are requested.

    The information provided by the \VAR{hints} is used to optimize for performance by the implementation.
    If the implementation cannot optimize, the behavior is same as \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}.
    If more than one hint is provided, the implementation will make the best effort to use one or more hints
    to optimize performance.

    The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc\_with\_hints} routine is provided  so that multiple \acp{PE} in a program can allocate symmetric,
    remotely accessible memory blocks.  When no action is performed, these
    routines return without performing a barrier. Otherwise, the routine will call a procedure that is
    semantically equivalent to \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} on exit, similar to the behavior of \FUNC{shmem\_malloc}.
    The user is responsible for calling this routine with identical argument(s) on all
    \acp{PE}; if differing \VAR{size}, or \VAR{hints} arguments are used, the behavior of the call
    is undefined.

\apireturnvalues{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc\_with\_hints} routine returns a pointer to the allocated space;
    otherwise, it returns a null pointer.

\apinotes{
    \openshmem programs should allocate memory with
    \CONST{SHMEM\_MALLOC\_ATOMICS\_REMOTE} when the majority of
    operations performed on this memory are atomic operations, and origin
    and target \acp{PE} of the atomic operations do not share a memory domain.
    That is, symmetric objects on the target \ac{PE} are not accessible using
    load/store operations from the origin \ac{PE} or vice versa.
