\begin{apiarguments}
  \apiargument{IN}{size}{The size, in bytes, of a block to be
    allocated from the symmetric heap.}
\end{apiarguments}


\apidescription{
  The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} routine is a collective operation on the
  world team and returns the symmetric address of a
  block of at least \VAR{size} bytes, which shall be suitably aligned
  so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object.
  This space is allocated from the symmetric heap (in contrast to
  \FUNC{malloc}, which allocates from the private heap).
  When \VAR{size} is zero, the \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} routine performs
  no action and returns a null pointer; otherwise,
  \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} calls a procedure that is semantically equivalent 
  to \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} on exit. This ensures that all \acp{PE} participate
  in the memory allocation, and that the memory on other \acp{PE} can be used as soon as the local
  \ac{PE} returns. 
  The value of the \VAR{size} argument must be identical on all
  \acp{PE}; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
}

\apireturnvalues{
  The \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} routine returns the symmetric address of
