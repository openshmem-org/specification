All OpenSHMEM implementations supporting the use of multiple Symmetric Memory
Partitions provide support for special environment variable called
SHMEM\_SYMMETRIC\_PARTITION to create and define the properties of the user-
defined Symmetric Memory Partitions. The properties of the memory partition
including the symmetric heap size are passed as specifiers to the environment
variable. 

\begin{envvardefinition}
\begin{envvarname}
SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_PARTITION<ID>=SIZE=<size>[:PGSIZE=<pgsize>][:KIND=<kind>:POLICY=<policy>]
\end{envvarname}

\begin{envvararguments}
    \envvarargument{REQ}{ID}{Integer to represent the partition number}
    \envvarargument{REQ}{SIZE}{Number of bytes to allocate for symmetric heap}
    \envvarargument{OPT}{PGSIZE}{Number of bytes to specify the memory page size}
    \envvarargument{OPT}{KIND}{String constants to specify the memory kind if
    multiple memory kinds are supported by the system supporting heterogeneous
    symmetric heap}
    \envvarargument{OPT}{POLICY}{String constants to specify the memory
    allocation policy}
\end{envvararguments}

One, two, or more partitions can be specified using this environment variable.
Each partition is represented using a number called \emph{Partition ID}.
\textless ID\textgreater is the user-specified part of the environment variable
to represent the Partition ID. A maximum of SHMEM\_MAX\_PARTITIONS can be
specified and the Partition ID may be any non-zero positive integers between 1
and SHMEM\_MAX\_PARTITION\_ID.

Each partition can take a maximum of four property specifiers as input. The
\emph{SIZE} specifier is the only required value. It is used to specify the
required symmetric heap size on the partition. The \emph{PGSIZE} specifier is
used to specify the page size of the memory kind.

On systems supporting heterogenous memory, each available memory kind should be
documented and made available as string constants to the users. The \emph{KIND}
specifier can be used to set the memory kind to specify the location of the
memory partition.



\envvarnotes{
    SHMEM\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE is supported with its current syntax and meaning.
    But, it is an error to use both SHMEM\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE and any form of
    SHMEM\_SYMMETRIC\_PARTITION environment variables together.

    All supported page sizes, memory kinds and memory policies should be
    documented by the implementation. }

\end{envvardefinition}
