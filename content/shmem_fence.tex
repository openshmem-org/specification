\apidescription{
    This routine assures ordering of delivery of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store
    routines to symmetric data objects.  All \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store
    routines to symmetric data objects issued to a particular remote \ac{PE}
    on the given context prior
    to the call to \FUNC{shmem\_fence} are guaranteed to be delivered before any
    subsequent \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to symmetric data
    objects to the same \ac{PE}. \FUNC{shmem\_fence} guarantees order of delivery,
    not completion.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} only provides per-\ac{PE} ordering guarantees and does not
    guarantee completion of delivery.  
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} also does not have an effect on the ordering between memory 
    accesses issued by the target PE. \FUNC{shmem\_wait}, \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until}, \FUNC{shmem\_test},
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}, \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} routines can be called by the target PE to guarantee 
    ordering of its memory accesses.
    There is a subtle difference between
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} and \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}, in that, \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}
    guarantees completion of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to
    symmetric data objects which makes the updates visible to all other
    \acp{PE}. 
    
    The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine should be called if completion of \PUT{},
    \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to symmetric data objects is desired
    when multiple remote \acp{PE} are involved.

    In an \openshmem program with multithreaded \acp{PE}, it is the
    user's responsibility to ensure ordering between operations issued by the threads
    in a \ac{PE} that target symmetric memory (e.g. \PUT{}, \ac{AMO}, memory stores,
    and nonblocking routines) and calls by threads in that \ac{PE} to
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence}. The \FUNC{shmem\_fence} routine can enforce memory store ordering only for the
    calling thread. Thus, to ensure ordering for memory stores performed by a thread that is
    not the thread calling \FUNC{shmem\_fence}, the update must be made visible to the
    calling thread according to the rules of the memory model associated with
    the threading environment.

    will be ordered to be delivered before \VAR{put4}.}
