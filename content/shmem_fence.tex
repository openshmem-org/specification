\apidescription{
    This routine assures ordering of delivery of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store
    routines to symmetric data objects.  All \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store
    routines to symmetric data objects issued to a particular remote \ac{PE} prior
    to the call to \FUNC{shmem\_fence} are guaranteed to be delivered before any
    subsequent \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to symmetric data
    objects to the same \ac{PE}. \FUNC{shmem\_fence} guarantees order of delivery,
    not completion.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} only provides per-\ac{PE} ordering guarantees and does
    not guarantee completion of delivery.  There is a subtle difference between
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} and \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}, in that, \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}
    guarantees completion of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to
    symmetric data objects which makes the updates visible to all other
    \acp{PE}. 
    
    The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine should be called if completion of PUT{},
    \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to symmetric data objects is desired
    when multiple remote \ac{PE}s are involved.

    {The following \FUNC{shmem\_fence} example is for \CorCpp{} programs: }
    {./example_code/shmem_fence_example.c}
    {\VAR{Put1} will be ordered to be delivered before \VAR{put3} and \VAR{put2}
    will be ordered to be delivered before \VAR{put4}.}
