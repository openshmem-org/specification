\apidescription{
    This routine assures ordering of delivery of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory
    store routines to symmetric data objects.  All \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory
    store routines to symmetric data objects issued to a particular remote
    \ac{PE} prior to the call to \FUNC{shmem\_fence} are guaranteed to be
    delivered before any subsequent \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines
    to symmetric data objects to the same \ac{PE}. \FUNC{shmem\_fence}
    guarantees order of delivery, not completion.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} only provides per-\ac{PE} ordering guarantees and does
    not guarantee completion of delivery.  There is a subtle difference between
    \FUNC{shmem\_fence} and \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}, in that, \FUNC{shmem\_quiet}
    guarantees completion of \PUT{}, \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to
    symmetric data objects which makes the updates visible to all other
    \acp{PE}. 
    
    The \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine should be called if completion of PUT{},
    \acp{AMO}, and memory store routines to symmetric data objects is desired
    when multiple remote \ac{PE}s are involved.

    The order in which updates performed through the OpenSHMEM interface become
    visible in local memory at the target \ac{PE} is not specified. This order
    is affected by multiple factors, including the memory model of the
    underlying architecture. The \FUNC{shmem\_wait} and
    \FUNC{shmem\_wait\_until} operations can be used to portably ensure
    visibility of updates that occurred and were ordered prior to the update
    satisfying the wait operation.

    {./example_code/shmem_fence_example.c}
    {\VAR{Put1} will be ordered to be delivered before \VAR{put3} and \VAR{put2}
    will be ordered to be delivered before \VAR{put4}.}
