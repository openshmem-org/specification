\begin{apiarguments}

\apiargument{IN}{PE\_start}{The lowest \ac{PE} number of the active set of \acp{PE}.
    \VAR{PE\_start} must be of type integer.  When using \Fortran, it must be
    a default integer value.}
\apiargument{IN}{logPE\_stride}{The log (base 2) of the stride between consecutive
    \ac{PE} numbers in the active set.  \VAR{logPE\_stride} must be of type integer.
    When using \Fortran, it must be a default integer value.}
\apiargument{IN}{PE\_size}{The number of  \acp{PE} in the active set.  \VAR{PE\_size}
    must be of type integer.  When using  \Fortran, it must be a default
    integer value.}
\apiargument{IN}{pSync}{
    A symmetric work array of size \CONST{SHMEM\_BARRIER\_SYNC\_SIZE}.
    In \CorCpp, \VAR{pSync} must be an array of elements of type \CTYPE{long}.
    In \Fortran, \VAR{pSync} must be an array of elements of default integer type.
    Every element
    of this array must be initialized to \CONST{SHMEM\_SYNC\_VALUE} before any of
    the \acp{PE} in the active set enter \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} the first time.}

\end{apiarguments}

\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} is a collective synchronization routine over an
    active set.  Control returns from \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} after all \acp{PE} in
    the active set (specified by \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and
    \VAR{PE\_size}) have called \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}.
    
    As with all \openshmem collective routines, each of these routines assumes that
    only \acp{PE} in the active set call the routine.  If a \ac{PE} not  in  the
    active set calls an \openshmem collective routine, the behavior is undefined.
    
    The values of arguments \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and \VAR{PE\_size}
    must be the same value on all \acp{PE} in the active set.  The same work array must be
    passed in \VAR{pSync} to all \acp{PE} in the active set.
    
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} ensures that all previously issued stores and remote
    memory updates, including \acp{AMO} and \ac{RMA} operations, done by any of the
    \acp{PE} in the active set on the default context are complete before returning.
    
    The  same  \VAR{pSync} array may be reused on consecutive calls   to
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} if the same active set is used.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    If the \VAR{pSync} array is initialized at the run time, all
    \acp{PE} must be synchronized before the first call to \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}
    (e.g., by \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}) to ensure the array has been initialized
    by all \acp{PE} before it is used.
    
    If  the active set does not change, \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} can  be called
    repeatedly with the same \VAR{pSync} array.  No additional synchronization
    beyond that implied by \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} itself is necessary in this case.

    The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} routine can be used to
    portably ensure that memory access operations observe remote updates in the order
    enforced by initiator \acp{PE}.

    Calls to \FUNC{shmem\_ctx\_quiet} can be performed prior
    to calling the barrier routine to ensure completion of operations issued on
    additional contexts.

    \newtext{
    No team-based barrier is provided by \openshmem, as a team may have any
    number of communication contexts associated with the team.
    Applications seeking such an idiom should call \FUNC{shmem\_ctx\_quiet}
    on the desired context, followed by a call to \FUNC{shmem\_team\_sync}
    on the desired team.
