Initializes the \openshmem library, similar to \FUNC{shmem\_init}, and performs any
initialization required for supporting the provided thread level.

\begin{Csynopsis}
int @\FuncDecl{shmem\_init\_thread}@(int requested, int *provided);
\end{Csynopsis}

\begin{apiarguments}
\apiargument{IN}{requested}{The thread level support requested by the user.}
\apiargument{OUT}{provided}{The thread level support provided by the \openshmem implementation.}
\end{apiarguments}

\apidescription{
\FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread} initializes the \openshmem library in the same way as
\FUNC{shmem\_init}. In addition, \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread} also performs
the initialization required for supporting the provided thread level.
The argument \VAR{requested} is used to specify the desired level of
thread support. The argument \VAR{provided} returns the support level
provided by the library. The allowed values for \VAR{provided} and
\VAR{requested} are \CONST{SHMEM\_THREAD\_SINGLE}, \CONST{SHMEM\_THREAD\_FUNNELED},
\CONST{SHMEM\_THREAD\_SERIALIZED}, and \CONST{SHMEM\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE}.

The \FUNC{shmem\_init} and \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread} initialization
routines may be called multiple times within an \openshmem program. A
corresponding call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} must be made for each call to
an \openshmem initialization routine. The \openshmem library must not be
finalized until after the last call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} and may be
re-initialized with a subsequent call to an initialization routine.

If the call to \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread}
is unsuccessful in allocating and initializing resources for the
\openshmem library, then the behavior of any subsequent call
to the \openshmem library is undefined.


}

\apireturnvalues{
\FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread} returns 0 upon success; otherwise, it returns a
nonzero value.
}

\apinotes{
The \openshmem library can be initialized either by \FUNC{shmem\_init}
or \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread}. If the \openshmem library is initialized
by \FUNC{shmem\_init}, the library implementation can choose to
support any one of the defined thread levels.

The \openshmem library may not be able to change the level of threading support
provided after the first initialization call has been made.
