\apisummary{
    A collective operation that releases resources used by the \openshmem
    library.  This only terminates the \openshmem portion of a program, not the
    entire program.

\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} is a collective operation that ends the \openshmem
    portion of a program previously initialized by \FUNC{shmem\_init} or
    \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread} and releases resources used by the \openshmem library.
    This collective operation requires all \acp{PE} to participate in the call.
    There is an implicit global barrier in \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} so that pending
    communications are completed, and no resources can be released until all
    \acp{PE} have entered \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}. \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} must be
    the last \openshmem library call encountered in the \openshmem portion of a
    program. A call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} will release any resources
    initialized by a corresponding call to \FUNC{shmem\_init} or \FUNC{shmem\_init\_thread}.
    All processes that represent the \acp{PE} will still exist after the
    call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} returns, but they will no longer have access
    to any resources that have been released.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} releases all resources used by the \openshmem library
    including the symmetric memory heap and pointers initiated by
    \FUNC{shmem\_ptr}. This collective operation requires all \acp{PE} to
    participate in the call, not just a subset of the \acp{PE}. The
    non-\openshmem portion of a program may continue after a call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} by all \acp{PE}.
