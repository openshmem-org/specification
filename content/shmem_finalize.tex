\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} is a collective operation that ends the \openshmem
    portion of a program previously initialized by \FUNC{shmem\_init} and
    releases resources used by the \openshmem library. This collective
    operation requires all \acp{PE} to participate in the call. There is an
    implicit global barrier in \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} so that pending
    communications are completed, and no resources can be released until all
    \acp{PE} have entered \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}.
    This routine destroys all shareable contexts.  The user is
    responsible for destroying all contexts with the
    \CONST{SHMEM\_CTX\_PRIVATE} option enabled prior to calling this routine.
    Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} must be
    the last \openshmem library call encountered in the \openshmem portion of a
    program. A call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} will release any resources
    initialized by a corresponding call to \FUNC{shmem\_init}. All processes
    that represent the \acp{PE} will still exist after the
    call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} returns, but they will no longer have access
    to any resources that have been released.

\apireturnvalues{
    None.

\apinotes{
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} releases all resources used by the \openshmem library
    including the symmetric memory heap and pointers initiated by
    \FUNC{shmem\_ptr}. This collective operation requires all \acp{PE} to
    participate in the call, not just a subset of the \acp{PE}. The
    non-\openshmem portion of a program may continue after a call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} by all \acp{PE}.
