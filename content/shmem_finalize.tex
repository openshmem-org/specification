\apisummary{
    A collective operation that releases resources used by the \openshmem
    library.  This only terminates the \openshmem portion of a program, not the
    entire program.

\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} is a collective operation that ends the \openshmem
    portion of a program previously initialized by \FUNC{shmem\_init} and
    releases resources used by the \openshmem library. This collective
    operation requires all \acp{PE} to participate in the call. There is an
    implicit global barrier in \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} so that pending
    communication is completed, and no resources can be released until all
    \acp{PE} have entered \FUNC{shmem\_finalize}. \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} must be
    the last \openshmem library call encountered in the \openshmem portion of a
    program. A call to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} will release any resources
    initialized by a corresponding call to \FUNC{shmem\_init}. All processes and
    threads that represent the \acp{PE} will still exist after the call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} returns, but they will no longer have access to any
    resources that have been released.

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} releases all resources used by the \openshmem library
    including the symmetric memory heap and pointers initiated by
    \FUNC{shmem\_ptr}. This collective operation requires all \acp{PE} to
    participate in the call, not just a subset of the \acp{PE}. The
    non-\openshmem portion of a program may continue after a call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} by all \acp{PE}. There is an implicit
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} at the end of main, so that having an explicit call
    to \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} is optional. However, an explicit
    \FUNC{shmem\_finalize} may be required as an entry point for wrappers used
    by profiling or other tools that need to perform their own finalization.
