\chapter{Writing \openshmem Programs}
\section*{Incorporating \openshmem{} into Programs}\label{sec:writing_programs}

In this section, we describe how to write a ``Hello World" \openshmem program.
To write a ``Hello World" \openshmem program we need to: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Add the include file shmem.h (for \Clang) or shmem.fh (for \Fortran).
\item Add the initialization call \FUNC{shmem\_init}, (line 9).
\item Use OpenSHMEM calls to query the the total number of PEs (line 10) and PE
    id (line 11).
\item There is no explicit finalize call; either a return from \texttt{main()}
    (line 13) or an explicit \texttt{exit()} acts as an implicit \openshmem
    finalization.
\item In \openshmem the order in which lines appear in the output is not fixed
    as \ac{PE}s execute asynchronously in parallel.
\end{itemize}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\vspace{0.1in}
\numberedlisting{label=openshmem-hello,language=OSH2+C}
                {example_code/hello-openshmem.c}
\outputlisting{language=bash,caption={Expected Output (4 processors)}}
                {example_code/hello-openshmem-c.output}
\vspace{0.1in}
\end{minipage}

\openshmem also has a \Fortran{} API, so for completeness we will now give the
same program written in \Fortran, in listing~\ref{openshmem-hello-f90}:

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\vspace{0.1in}
\numberedlisting{label=openshmem-hello-f90,language=OSH2+F}
                {example_code/hello-openshmem.f90}
\outputlisting{language=bash,caption={Expected Output (4 processors)}}
                {example_code/hello-openshmem-f90.output}
\vspace{0.1in}
\end{minipage}

The following example shows a more complex \openshmem program that illustrates
the use of symmetric data objects.  Note the declaration of the  \VAR{static
short dest} array and its use as the remote destination in \openshmem short
\PUT.  The use of the \VAR{static} keyword results in the \VAR{dest} array being
symmetric on \ac{PE} \CONST{0} and \ac{PE} \CONST{1}.  Each \ac{PE} is able to
transfer data to the \dest{} array by simply specifying the local address of the
symmetric data object which is to receive the data.  This aids programmability,
as the address of the \dest{} need not be exchanged with the active side
(\ac{PE} \CONST{0}) prior to the RMA (Remote Memory Access) routine.
Conversely, the declaration of the \VAR{short source} array is asymmetric.
Because the \PUT{} handles the references to the \VAR{source} array only on the
active (local) side, the asymmetric \source{} object is handled correctly.

\outputlisting{language=bash,caption={Expected Output (4 processors)}}

\end{minipage}




\chapter{Compiling and Running Programs}\label{sec:compiling}
As of this writing, the \openshmem{} specification is silent regarding how
\openshmem{} programs are compiled, linked and run. This section shows some
examples of how wrapper programs are utilized in the \openshmem{} Reference
Implementation to compile and launch programs.

\section{Compilation}
\subsection*{Programs written in \Clang}

The \openshmem{} Reference Implementation provides a wrapper program named
\textbf{oshcc}, to aid in the compilation of \Clang{} programs, the wrapper
could be called as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
oshcc <compiler options> -o myprogram myprogram.c
\end{lstlisting}
Where the $\langle\mbox{compiler options}\rangle$ are options understood by the
underlying \Clang{} compiler.


\subsection*{Programs written in \Cpp}

The  \openshmem{} Reference Implementation provides a wrapper program named
\textbf{oshCC}, to aid in the compilation of \Cpp{} programs, the wrapper could
be called as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
oshCC <compiler options> -o myprogram myprogram.cpp
\end{lstlisting}
Where the $\langle\mbox{compiler options}\rangle$ are options understood by the
underlying \Cpp{} compiler called by \textbf{oshCC}.


\subsection*{Programs written in \Fortran}

The  \openshmem{} Reference Implementation provides a wrapper program named
\textbf{oshfort}, to aid in the compilation of \Fortran{} programs, the wrapper
could be called as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
oshfort <compiler options> -o myprogram myprogram.f
\end{lstlisting}
Where the $\langle\mbox{compiler options}\rangle$ are options understood by the
underlying \Fortran{} compiler called by \textbf{oshfort}.

\section{Running Programs}

The  \openshmem{} Reference Implementation provides a wrapper program named
\textbf{oshrun}, to launch \openshmem programs, the wrapper could be called as
follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
oshrun <additional options> -np <#> <program> <program arguments>
\end{lstlisting}
The program arguments for \textbf{oshrun} are:

\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\textwidth}p{0.6\textwidth}}
$\langle\mbox{additional options}\rangle$ & {Options passed to the underlying launcher.}\tabularnewline
-np $\langle\mbox{\#}\rangle$ & {The number of \ac{PE}s to be used in the execution.}\tabularnewline
$\langle\mbox{program}\rangle$ & {The program executable to be launched.}\tabularnewline
$\langle\mbox{program arguments}\rangle$ & {Flags and other parameters to pass to the program.}\tabularnewline
\end{tabular}





\chapter{Undefined Behavior in \openshmem}\label{sec:undefined}

The specification provides guidelines to the expected behavior of
various library routines.  In cases where routines are improperly used
or the input is not in accordance with the specification, undefined
behavior may be observed.  Depending on the implementation there are
many interpretations of undefined behavior. 

$\;$

$ $%
\begin{tabular}{|>{\raggedright}p{0.3\textwidth}|>{\raggedright}p{0.6\textwidth}|}
\hline 
\textbf{Inappropriate Usage} & \textbf{Undefined Behavior}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
Uninitialized library & If \openshmem is not initialized through a call to
\FUNC{shmem\_init}, subsequent accesses to \openshmem routines have undefined
results.  An implementation may choose, for example, to try to continue or abort
immediately upon the first call to an uninitialized routine.\tabularnewline
\hline 
Accessing non-existent \ac{PE}s & If a communications routine accesses a
non-existent \ac{PE}, then the \openshmem library can choose to handle this
situation in an implementation-defined way.  For example, the library may issue
an error message saying that the \ac{PE} accessed is outside the range of
accessible \ac{PE}s, or may exit without a warning.\tabularnewline
\hline 
Use of non-symmetric variables & Some routines require remotely accessible
variables to perform their function.  A \PUT{} to a non-symmetric variable can
be trapped where possible and the library can abort the program.  Another
implementation may choose to continue either with a warning or
silently.\tabularnewline
\hline 
Non-symmetric variables & The symmetric memory management routines are
collectives, which means that all \ac{PE}s in the program must issue the same
\FUNC{shmem\_malloc} call with the same size request.  Program behavior after a
mismatched \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} call is undefined.\tabularnewline
\hline 
Use of NULL pointers with non-zero \VAR{len} specified & In any \openshmem routine
that takes a pointer and \VAR{len} describing the number of elements in that
pointer, NULL may not be specified for the pointer unless the corresponding \VAR{len} is also
specified as zero. Otherwise, the resulting behavior is undefined.
The following cases summarize this behavior:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \VAR{len} is 0, pointer is NULL: supported.
    \item \VAR{len} is not 0, pointer is NULL: undefined behavior.
    \item \VAR{len} is 0, pointer is not NULL: supported.
    \item \VAR{len} is not 0, pointer is not NULL: supported.
\end{itemize}
\tabularnewline
\hline 
Multiple calls to \FUNC{shmem\_init} & In an OpenSHMEM program where
\FUNC{shmem\_init} has already be called, any subsequent calls to
\FUNC{shmem\_init} result in undefined behavior.\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}







\chapter{Interoperability with other Programming Models}\label{sec:mpi}

\section{\ac{MPI} Interoperability}

\begin{sloppypar} % to prevent constants from running into margins.
%
\openshmem routines can be used in conjunction with \ac{MPI} routines  in the
same program.  For example, on SGI systems, programs that use both \ac{MPI} and
\openshmem routines call \FUNC{MPI\_Init} and \FUNC{MPI\_Finalize} but omit the
call to the \FUNC{shmem\_init} routine.  \openshmem \ac{PE} numbers are equal to
the \ac{MPI} rank within the \CONST{MPI\_COMM\_WORLD} environment variable.
Note that this precludes use of \openshmem routines between processes in
different \CONST{MPI\_COMM\_WORLD}s.  \ac{MPI} processes started using the
\FUNC{MPI\_Comm\_spawn} routine, for example, cannot use \openshmem routines to
communicate with their parent \ac{MPI} processes.
%
\end{sloppypar}
%
On SGI systems where \ac{MPI} jobs use TCP/sockets for inter-host communication,
\openshmem routines can be used to communicate with processes running on the
same host.  The \FUNC{shmem\_pe\_accessible} routine can be used to determine if
a remote \ac{PE} is accessible via \openshmem communication from the local
\ac{PE}. When running an \ac{MPI} program involving multiple executable files,
\openshmem routines can be used to communicate with processes running from the
same or different executable files, provided that the communication is limited
to symmetric data objects.  On these systems, static memory such as a
\Fortran{} common block or \Clang{} global variable, is symmetric between
processes running from the same executable file, but is not symmetric between
processes running from different executable files.  Data allocated from the
symmetric heap (\FUNC{shmem\_malloc} or \FUNC{shpalloc}) is symmetric across the
same or different executable files. The routine \FUNC{shmem\_addr\_accessible}
can be used to determine if a local address is accessible via \openshmem
communication from a remote \ac{PE}.

Another important feature of these systems is that the
\FUNC{shmem\_pe\_accessible} routine returns \CONST{TRUE} only if the remote
\ac{PE} is a process running from the same executable file as the local PE,
indicating that full \openshmem support (static memory and symmetric heap) is
available.  When using \openshmem routines within an \ac{MPI} program, the use
of \ac{MPI} memory placement environment variables is required when using
non-default memory placement options.

\chapter{\openshmem Specification and Deprecated API}\label{sec:dep_api}

For the \openshmem Specification(s), deprecation is the process of identifying
API that is supported but no longer recommended for use by program users. For
\openshmem library users, said API \textbf{must} be supported until clearly
indicated as otherwise by the Specification. In this chapter we will record the
API that has been deprecated, the \openshmem Specification that effected the
deprecation, and if the feature is supported in the current version of the
specification.  

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}

\section{Version 1.2}
This section summarizes the changes from the \openshmem specification Version
1.1 to Version 1.2.  A major change in this version is that it improves upon the
execution model described in 1.1 by introducing an explicit

exiting an \openshmem program and releasing resources used by the library.  


The following list describes the specific changes in 1.2:

\begin{itemize}
%
\item Added specification of \VAR{pSync} initialization for all routines that use it.
%
\item Replaced all placeholder variable names \VAR{target} with \VAR{dest} to
      avoid confusion with Fortran `target' keyword.
%

\\See Section \ref{subsec:shfree}.
%
\item Deprecation of Fortran API routine \FUNC{SHMEM\_PUT}.

      support in the existing specification version.
\\See Annex \ref{sec:dep_api}.
%
\end{itemize}
