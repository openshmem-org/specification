\apidescription{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_pe\_quiet} ensures completion of memory store, blocking 
    \PUT{}, \ac{AMO}, and \emph{put-with-signal}, as well as  nonblocking
    \PUT{}, \emph{put-with-signal}, and \GET{} routines on the symmetric data
    objects issued by the calling \ac{PE} to the target \acp{PE} and on the
    given context.
	
	The completion and visibility semantics of these routines are the same as the
	\FUNC{shmem\_quiet} routine. However, it applies only to the target
    \acp{PE}, i.e., the routines to the target \acp{PE} are guaranteed to be
    complete and visible to all \acp{PE} when \FUNC{shmem\_pe\_quiet} returns.
