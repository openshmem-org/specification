\apidescription{

The \FUNC{shmem\_req\_wait} function is a blocking operation used to determine whether an
operation identified by the request object has been completed. If the operation
is completed, \FUNC{shmem\_req\_wait} returns zero, and the request object is
deallocated and cannot be reused. If the operation has not been completed,
\FUNC{shmem\_req\_wait} blocks until the operation completes and then returns
zero. If the request object is not valid, behavior is undefined.

In a multithreaded environment, \FUNC{shmem\_req\_wait} can be called by different
threads but on different request objects. It is the responsibility of the
\openshmem user to ensure that proper synchronization is used to prevent race
conditions or deadlock.

    On success returns zero, otherwise returns a negative integer.
