\apidescription{

The \FUNC{shmem\_req\_wait} function is a blocking operation used to
determine whether an operation identified by the request object has
been completed. When the operation is completed, \FUNC{shmem\_req\_wait} returns
zero, and the request object is deallocated and set to \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_REQ\_INVALID}.
If the request object is not valid (i.e., it is set to
\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_REQ\_INVALID}), no operation is performed and a negative
value is returned.

In a multithreaded environment, \FUNC{shmem\_req\_wait} can be called by different
threads but on different request objects. It is the responsibility of the
\openshmem user to ensure that proper synchronization is used to prevent race
conditions or deadlock.

\apireturnvalues{
    On success returns zero, otherwise returns a negative integer.
