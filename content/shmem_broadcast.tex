    that is permissible for the \dest{} argument.}

    \acp{PE}.  \VAR{PE\_start} must be of type integer.}
\apiargument{IN}{logPE\_stride}{ The log (base 2) of the stride between
    consecutive \ac{PE} numbers in the active set. \VAR{log\_PE\_stride} must be of

\apiargument{IN}{PE\_size}{ The number of \acp{PE} in the active set.
    \VAR{PE\_size} must be of type integer.}
\apiargument{IN}{pSync}{
    A symmetric work array of size \CONST{SHMEM\_BCAST\_SYNC\_SIZE}.
    In \CorCpp, \VAR{pSync} must be an array of elements of type \CTYPE{long}.
    Every element of this array must be initialized with the value
    \CONST{SHMEM\_SYNC\_VALUE} before any of the \acp{PE} in the active set
    enters \FUNC{shmem\_broadcast}.}

\apidescription{
    \openshmem broadcast routines are collective routines.  They copy data object
    \source{} on the processor specified by \VAR{PE\_root} and store the values at
    \dest{} on the other \acp{PE} specified by the triplet \VAR{PE\_start},
    \VAR{logPE\_stride}, \VAR{PE\_size}.  The data is not copied to the \dest{} area
    on the root \ac{PE}.

    As with all \openshmem collective routines, each of these routines assumes that
    only \acp{PE} in the active set call the routine.  If a \ac{PE} not in the
    active set calls an \openshmem collective routine, the behavior is undefined.

    The values of arguments \VAR{PE\_root}, \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride},
    and \VAR{PE\_size} must be the same value on all \acp{PE} in the active set.  The same
    \dest{} and \source{} data objects and the same \VAR{pSync} work array must be
    passed by all \acp{PE} in the active set.

    Before any \ac{PE} calls a broadcast routine,
    the following conditions must be ensured:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \VAR{pSync} array on all \acp{PE} in the active set is
      not still in use from a prior call to a broadcast routine.
    \item The \dest{} array on all \acp{PE} in the active set is ready
      to accept the broadcast data.
    \end{itemize}
    Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

    Upon return from a broadcast routine, the following are true for the local
    \ac{PE}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If the current \ac{PE} is not the root \ac{PE},
      the \dest{} data object is updated.
    \item The \source{} data object may be safely reused.
    \item The values in the \VAR{pSync} array are restored to the
      original values.
    \end{itemize}
}

\apidesctable{
The  \dest{}  and \source{} data  objects must conform to certain typing
constraints, which are as follows:
}{Routine}{Data type of \VAR{dest} and \VAR{source}}

\apitablerow{shmem\_broadcast64}{Any noncharacter
    type that has an element size of \CONST{64} bits. No
    \CorCpp{} structures are allowed.}
\apitablerow{shmem\_broadcast32}{Any noncharacter
    type that has an element size of \CONST{32} bits. No
    \CorCpp{} structures are allowed.}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    All \openshmem broadcast routines restore \VAR{pSync} to its original contents.
    Multiple calls to \openshmem routines that use the same \VAR{pSync} array do not
    require that \VAR{pSync} be reinitialized after the first call.

    The user must ensure that the \VAR{pSync} array is not being updated by any
    \ac{PE} in the active set while any of the \acp{PE} participates in processing
    of an \openshmem broadcast routine. Be careful to avoid these situations: If the
    \VAR{pSync} array is initialized at run time, before its first use, some type of synchronization is
    needed to ensure that all \acp{PE} in the active set have initialized
    \VAR{pSync} before any of them enter an \openshmem routine called with the
    \VAR{pSync} synchronization array.  A \VAR{pSync} array may be reused on a
    subsequent \openshmem broadcast routine only if none of the \acp{PE} in the
    active set are still processing a prior \openshmem broadcast routine call that
    used the same \VAR{pSync} array. In general, this can be ensured only by doing
    some type of synchronization.
