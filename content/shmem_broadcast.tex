\apidescription{   
    \openshmem broadcast routines are collective routines over an active set or
    valid \openshmem team.
    They copy the \source{} data object on the \ac{PE} specified by
    \VAR{PE\_root} to the \dest{} data object on the \acp{PE}
    participating in the collective operation.
    The same \dest{} and \source{} data objects and the same value of
    \VAR{PE\_root} must be passed by all \acp{PE} participating in the
    collective operation.


    For team-based broadcasts:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \dest{} object is updated on all \acp{PE}.
    \item All \acp{PE} in the \VAR{team} argument must participate in
      the operation.
    \item If an invalid team handle or
      \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID} is passed to this routine,
      the behavior is undefined.
    \item \ac{PE} numbering is relative to the team. The specified
      root \ac{PE} must be a valid \ac{PE} number for the team,
      between \CONST{0} and \VAR{N$-$1}, where \VAR{N} is the size of
      the team.
    \end{itemize}
    
    For active-set-based broadcasts:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \dest{} object is updated on all \acp{PE} other than the
      root \ac{PE}.
    \item All \acp{PE} in the active set defined by the
      \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, \VAR{PE\_size} triplet
      must participate in the operation.
    \item Only \acp{PE} in the active set may call the routine.  If a
      \ac{PE} not in the active set calls an active-set-based
      collective routine, the behavior is undefined.
    \item The values of arguments \VAR{PE\_root}, \VAR{PE\_start},
      \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and \VAR{PE\_size} must be the same value
      on all \acp{PE} in the active set.
    \item The value of \VAR{PE\_root} must be between \CONST{0} and
      \VAR{PE\_size $-$ 1}.
    \item The same \VAR{pSync} work array must be passed by all \acp{PE}
      in the active set.
    \end{itemize}

    Before any \ac{PE} calls a broadcast routine, the following
    conditions must be ensured:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \dest{} array on all \acp{PE} participating in the broadcast
      is ready to accept the broadcast data.
    \item For active-set-based broadcasts, the
      \VAR{pSync} array on all \acp{PE} in the
      active set is not still in use from a prior call to a collective
      \openshmem routine.
    \end{itemize}
    Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

    Upon return from a broadcast routine, the following are true for the local
    \ac{PE}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For team-based broadcasts, the \dest{} data object is
      updated.
    \item For active-set-based broadcasts:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item If the current \ac{PE} is not the root \ac{PE}, the
        \dest{} data object is updated.
      \item The values in the \VAR{pSync} array are restored to the
        original values.
      \end{itemize}
    \item The \source{} data object may be safely reused.
    \end{itemize}
}

\apidesctable{
The  \dest{}  and \source{} data  objects must conform to certain typing
constraints, which are as follows:
}{Routine}{Data type of \VAR{dest} and \VAR{source}}

\apitablerow{\FUNC{shmem\_broadcastmem}}{\source{} and \dest{} objects are
  byte aligned; \VAR{nelems} is the object size in bytes}
\apitablerow{\FUNC{shmem\_broadcast64}}{\source{} and \dest{} objects are
  8-byte aligned; \VAR{nelems} is the count of the number of 8-byte
  elements}
\apitablerow{\FUNC{shmem\_broadcast32}}{\source{} and \dest{} objects are
  4-byte aligned; \VAR{nelems} is the count of the number of 4-byte
  elements}

\apireturnvalues{
  For team-based broadcasts, zero on successful local completion; otherwise, nonzero.

  For active-set-based broadcasts, none.
}

\apinotes{
    Active-set-based \openshmem broadcast routines restore \VAR{pSync} to its original contents.
    Multiple calls to active-set-based routines that use the same \VAR{pSync} array do not
    require that \VAR{pSync} be reinitialized after the first call.

    The user must ensure that the \VAR{pSync} array is not being updated by any
    \ac{PE} in the active set while any of the \acp{PE} participates in processing
    of an \openshmem broadcast routine. Be careful to avoid these situations: If the
    \VAR{pSync} array is initialized at run time, before its first use, some type of synchronization is
    needed to ensure that all \acp{PE} in the active set have initialized
    \VAR{pSync} before any of them enter an \openshmem routine called with the
    \VAR{pSync} synchronization array.  A \VAR{pSync} array may be reused on a
    subsequent \openshmem broadcast routine only if none of the \acp{PE} in the
    active set are still processing a prior \openshmem broadcast routine call that
    used the same \VAR{pSync} array. In general, this can be ensured only by doing
    some type of synchronization.        

    Team handle error checking and integer return codes are currently undefined.
    Implementations may define these behaviors as needed, but programs should
    ensure portability by doing their own checks for invalid team handles and for
    \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}.
