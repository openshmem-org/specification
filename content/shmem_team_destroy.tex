\apidescription{

The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_destroy} routine is a collective operation that
destroys the team referenced by the team handle argument \VAR{team}.
Upon return, the referenced team is invalid.

This routine destroys all shareable contexts created from the
referenced team.  The user is responsible for destroying all contexts
created from this team with the \CONST{SHMEM\_CTX\_PRIVATE} option
enabled prior to calling this routine; otherwise, the behavior is
undefined.

It is an error to destroy the default team or any other predefined team.

If \VAR{team} compares equal to \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID},
then no operation is performed.
If \VAR{team} is otherwise invalid, the behavior is undefined.
