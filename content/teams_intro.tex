The \acp{PE} in an \openshmem program communicate using either
point-to-point routines, which specify the \ac{PE} number of the target
\ac{PE}, or collective routines, which operate over a set of \acp{PE}.
In \openshmem, teams allow programs to group a set of \acp{PE} for
communication.
Team-based collective communications operate across all the \acp{PE}
in a valid team.
Point-to-point communication can make use of team-relative \ac{PE}
numbering through team-based contexts (see Section~\ref{sec:ctx}) or
\ac{PE} number translation.

\subsubsection*{Predefined and Program-Defined Teams}

An \openshmem team may be predefined (i.e., provided by the \openshmem
library) or defined by the \openshmem program.
A program-defined team is created by ``splitting'' a parent team into
one or more new teams---each with some subset of \acp{PE} of the
parent team---via one of the \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_*} routines.

All predefined teams are valid for the duration of the \openshmem
portion of an application.
Any team successfully created by a \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_*}
routine is valid until it is destroyed.
All valid teams have a least one member.

\subsubsection*{Team Handles}

A ``team handle'' is an opaque object with type \CTYPE{shmem\_team\_t}
that is used to reference a team.
Team handles are not remotely accessible objects
The predefined teams may be accessed via the team handles listed in
Section~\ref{subsec:library_handles}.

\openshmem communication routines that do not accept a team handle
argument operate on the default team, which may be accessed through
the \LibHandleRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_WORLD} handle.
The default team encompasses the set of all \acp{PE} in the \openshmem
program, and a \ac{PE} number in the default team is the same as the
value returned by \FUNC{shmem\_my\_pe}.

A team handle may be initialized to or assigned the value
\CONST{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID} to indicate that handle does not
reference a valid team.
When managed in this way, applications can use an equality comparison
to test whether a given team handle references a valid team.

\subsubsection*{Thread Safety}

When it is allowed by the threading model provided by the OpenSHMEM
library, a team may be used concurrently in non-collective operations
(e.g., \FUNC{shmem\_team\_my\_pe}) by multiple threads within the
\ac{PE} where it was created.
For collective operations, a team may not be used concurrently by
multiple threads in the same \ac{PE}.

\subsubsection*{Collective Ordering}

In \openshmem, a team object encapsulates resources used to communicate
between \acp{PE} in collective operations. When calling multiple subsequent
collective operations on a team, the collective operations---along with any
relevant team based resources---are matched across the \acp{PE} in the team
based on ordering of collective routine calls. It is the responsibility
of the \openshmem program to ensure the same ordering of collective routine calls
across all \acp{PE} in a team.

There is no need for explicit synchronization between subsequent calls
to collective routines across the team, except in the special case discussed
below for team creation of overlapping child teams from a common parent team.

A full discussion of collective semantics follows in Section~\ref{subsec:coll}.

\subsubsection*{Team Creation}

Team creation is a collective operation on the parent team object. New teams
result from a \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_*} routine, which takes a parent team
and other arguments and produces new teams that are a subset of the parent
team. Teams that are created by a \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_*} routine may be
provided a configuration argument that specifies attributes of each new team.
This configuration argument is of type \CTYPE{shmem\_team\_config\_t}, which
is detailed further in Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_config_t}.

As with any collective routine on a team, the program must ensure that there
are no simultaneous split operations occurring on the same parent team on a
given \ac{PE}, i.e. in separate threads.

As with any collective routine on a team, team creation is matched across PEs based
on ordering. So, team creation events must occur in the same order on all \acp{PE}
in the parent team. Additionally, there must not be team creation
operations from the same parent team simultaneously occurring that involve
the same \acp{PE} in any resulting child teams.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] The following rule of practice will avoid any conflicts on team
object resources during team creation:
\item[] \emph{When a parent team is split multiple times, and the resulting child teams
have overlapping membership, the program must call the \FUNC{shmem\_team\_sync}
routine on the parent team between subsequent calls to split routines.}
\end{itemize}

Upon completion of a team creation operation, any resulting child teams will be
immediately usable for any team-based operations, including creating new child teams,
without any intervening synchronization.
