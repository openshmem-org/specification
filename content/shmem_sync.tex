\begin{apiarguments}

\apiargument{IN}{PE\_start}{The lowest \ac{PE} number of the \activeset of
    \acp{PE}.  \VAR{PE\_start} must be of type integer.}
\apiargument{IN}{logPE\_stride}{The log (base 2) of the stride between
    consecutive \ac{PE} numbers in the \activeset.  \VAR{logPE\_stride} must be
    of type integer.}
\apiargument{IN}{PE\_size}{The number of \acp{PE} in the \activeset.
    \VAR{PE\_size} must be of type integer.}
\apiargument{IN}{pSync}{A symmetric work array. In \CorCpp, \VAR{pSync} must be
    of type long and size \CONST{SHMEM\_BARRIER\_SYNC\_SIZE}.  Every element of
    this array must be initialized to \CONST{SHMEM\_SYNC\_VALUE} before any of the
    \acp{PE} in the \activeset enter \FUNC{shmem\_sync} the first time.}

\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_sync} is a collective synchronization routine over an
    \activeset.  Control returns from \FUNC{shmem\_sync} after all \acp{PE} in
    the \activeset (specified by \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and
    \VAR{PE\_size}) have called \FUNC{shmem\_sync}.

    As with all \openshmem collective routines, each of these routines assumes
    that only \acp{PE} in the \activeset call the routine.  If a \ac{PE} not in
    the \activeset calls an \openshmem collective routine, undefined behavior
    results.

    The values of arguments \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and
    \VAR{PE\_size} must be equal on all \acp{PE} in the \activeset.  The same
    work array must be passed in \VAR{pSync} to all \acp{PE} in the \activeset.

    In contrast with the \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} routine, \FUNC{shmem\_sync} only
    ensures completion of previously issued memory stores and does not ensure
    completion of remote memory updates issued via \openshmem routines.

    The same \VAR{pSync} array may be reused on consecutive calls to
    \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} if the same active \ac{PE} set is used.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    If the \VAR{pSync} array is initialized at run time, be sure to use some type of
    synchronization, for example, a call to \FUNC{shmem\_sync\_all}, before
    calling \FUNC{shmem\_sync} for the first time.

    If the \activeset does not change, \FUNC{shmem\_sync} can be called
    repeatedly with the same \VAR{pSync} array.  No additional synchronization
    beyond that implied by \FUNC{shmem\_sync} itself is necessary in this case.

    The \FUNC{shmem\_sync\_all} routine can be used to portably ensure that
    memory access operations observe remote updates in the order enforced by
    initiator \acp{PE}, provided that the initiator PE ensures completion of remote
    updates with a call to \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} prior to the call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_sync\_all} routine.
