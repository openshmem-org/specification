\apiargument{IN}{pSync}{A symmetric work array. In \CorCpp, \VAR{pSync} must be
    of type \CTYPE{long} and size \CONST{SHMEM\_BARRIER\_SYNC\_SIZE}.  Every element of

    \acp{PE} in the active set enter \FUNC{shmem\_sync} the first time.}

\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_sync} is a collective synchronization routine over
    \newtext {a \ac{PE} team or} an active set.
    Control returns from \FUNC{shmem\_sync} after all \acp{PE} in
    the \newtext{specified \ac{PE} team or} active set \oldtext{(specified by \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and
    \VAR{PE\_size})} have called \FUNC{shmem\_sync}.
    \newtext{
    An active set is specified by the triple of values: \VAR{PE\_start},
    \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and \VAR{PE\_size}.
    }

    As with all \openshmem collective routines, each of these routines assumes
    that only \acp{PE} in the active set call the routine.  If a \ac{PE} not in
    the active set calls an \openshmem collective routine, the behavior is undefined.

    \begin{FeedbackRequest}
      Do we need to say something like the above for team-based collectives?
      We already say that teams are not portable across PEs, so only the PE
      that created the team could invoke it in a collective without undefined
      behavior.

      Should we have a harder partition between the description text between
      the team- and active set-based API (since the active set and pSync
      requirements don't affect the team call)?
    \end{FeedbackRequest}
    
    The values of arguments \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride}, and
    \VAR{PE\_size} must be equal on all \acp{PE} in the active set.  The same
    work array must be passed in \VAR{pSync} to all \acp{PE} in the active set.

    In contrast with the \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} routine\newtext{s}, \FUNC{shmem\_sync} only
    ensures completion and visibility of previously issued memory stores and does not ensure
    completion of remote memory updates issued via \openshmem routines.

    The same \VAR{pSync} array may be reused on consecutive calls to
    \FUNC{shmem\_sync} if the same active set is used.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    If the \VAR{pSync} array is initialized at run time, another method of
    synchronization (e.g., \FUNC{shmem\_sync\_all}) must be used before
    the initial use of that \VAR{pSync} array by \FUNC{shmem\_sync}.

    If the active set does not change, \FUNC{shmem\_sync} can be called
    repeatedly with the same \VAR{pSync} array.  No additional synchronization
    beyond that implied by \FUNC{shmem\_sync} itself is necessary in this case.

    The \FUNC{shmem\_sync} routine can be used to portably ensure that
    memory access operations observe remote updates in the order enforced by the
    initiator \acp{PE}, provided that the initiator PE ensures completion of remote
    updates with a call to \FUNC{shmem\_quiet} prior to the call to the
    \FUNC{shmem\_sync} routine.
