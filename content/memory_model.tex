An \openshmem program consists of data objects that are private to each \ac{PE}
and data  objects that are remotely accessible by all \acp{PE}. Private data
objects are stored in the local memory of each \ac{PE} and can only be accessed
by the \ac{PE} itself; these data objects cannot be accessed by other \acp{PE}
via \openshmem routines. Private data objects follow the memory model of
\Cstd or \Fortran. Remotely accessible objects, however, can be accessed by
remote \acp{PE} using \openshmem routines.  Remotely accessible data objects are
called \emph{Symmetric Data Objects}.  Each symmetric data object has a
corresponding object with the same name, type, and size on all \acp{PE} where that object is
accessible via the \openshmem \ac{API}\footnote{For efficiency reasons,
the same offset (from an arbitrary memory address) for symmetric data
objects might be used on all \acp{PE}. Further discussion about symmetric heap
layout and implementation efficiency can be found in section
\ref{subsec:shfree}}.  (For the definition of what is accessible, see the
descriptions for \FUNC{shmem\_pe\_accessible} and \FUNC{shmem\_addr\_accessible}
in sections \ref{subsec:shmem_pe_accessible} and
\ref{subsec:shmem_addr_accessible}.) Symmetric data objects accessed via typed and
type-generic \openshmem interfaces are required to be naturally aligned based on their type
requirements and underlying architecture.  In \openshmem the following kinds of
data objects are symmetric:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{deprecate}
    \Fortran data objects in common blocks or with the \CTYPE{SAVE} attribute.
    These data objects must not be defined in a dynamic shared object (DSO).
  \end{deprecate}
\item Global and static \Cstd and \Cpp variables. These data objects must
  not  be defined in a DSO.
\item
  \begin{deprecate}
    \Fortran arrays allocated with \FUNC{shpalloc}
  \end{deprecate}
\item \Cstd and \Cpp data allocated by \openshmem memory management routines
  (Section~\ref{sec:memory_management})
\end{itemize}       

\openshmem dynamic memory allocation routines (\FUNC{shpalloc} and
\FUNC{shmem\_malloc}) allow collective allocation of \emph{Symmetric Data
Objects} on a special memory region called the \emph{Symmetric Heap}. The
Symmetric Heap is created during the execution of a program at a memory location
determined by the implementation. The Symmetric Heap may reside in different
memory regions on different \acp{PE}. Figure~\ref{fig:mem_model} shows how
\openshmem implements a \ac{PGAS} model using remotely accessible symmetric
objects and private data objects when executing an \openshmem program.
Symmetric data objects are stored on the symmetric heap or in the global/static
memory section of each \ac{PE}. 

\subsection{Atomicity Guarantees}\label{subsec:amo_guarantees}

\openshmem contains a number of routines that perform atomic operations on
symmetric data objects (Section \ref{sec:amo}).  These routines guarantee that
concurrent accesses to the same location by \openshmem atomic operations using
the same datatype will be exclusive.  However, they do not guarantee
exclusivity when concurrent accesses to the same location are performed using
\openshmem atomic operations using different datatypes, when non-atomic
\openshmem operations are used to access the given location, or when
non-\openshmem operations are performed on the given location.  The result in
such scenarios is undefined.

For example: during the execution of an atomic remote integer increment
operation on a symmetric variable \VAR{X}, no other \openshmem atomic operation
may access \VAR{X}.  After the increment, \VAR{X} will have increased its value
by \CONST{1} on the destination \ac{PE}, at which point other atomic operations
may then modify that \VAR{X}.  However, access to the symmetric object \VAR{X}
with non-atomic operations, such as one-sided \OPR{put} or \OPR{get} operations,
will invalidate the atomicity guarantees.
