%
An \openshmem program consists of data objects that are private to each \ac{PE}
and data  objects that are remotely accessible by all \acp{PE}. Private data
objects are stored in the local memory of each \ac{PE} and can only be accessed
by the \ac{PE} itself; these data objects cannot be accessed by other \acp{PE}
via \openshmem routines. Private data objects follow the memory model of
\Cstd. Remotely accessible objects, however, can be accessed by
remote \acp{PE} using \openshmem routines.  Remotely accessible data objects are
called \emph{Symmetric Data Objects}.  Each symmetric data object has a
corresponding object with the same name, type, and size on all \acp{PE} where that object is
accessible via the \openshmem \ac{API}\footnote{For efficiency reasons,
the same offset (from an arbitrary memory address) for symmetric data
objects might be used on all \acp{PE}. Further discussion about symmetric heap
layout and implementation efficiency can be found in section
\ref{subsec:shfree}}.  (For the definition of what is accessible, see the
descriptions for \FUNC{shmem\_pe\_accessible} and \FUNC{shmem\_addr\_accessible}
in sections \ref{subsec:shmem_pe_accessible} and
\ref{subsec:shmem_addr_accessible}.) In \openshmem the following kinds of
data objects are symmetric:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Global and static \Cstd and \Cpp variables. These data objects must
  not be defined in a dynamic shared object (DSO).
\item \Cstd and \Cpp data allocated by \openshmem memory management routines
  (Section~\ref{sec:memory_management})
\end{itemize}

\openshmem dynamic memory allocation routines (e.g.,
\FUNC{shmem\_malloc}) allow collective allocation of \emph{Symmetric Data
Objects} on a special memory region called the \emph{Symmetric Heap}. The
Symmetric Heap is created during the execution of a program at a memory location
determined by the implementation. The Symmetric Heap may reside in different
memory regions on different \acp{PE}.
Figure~\ref{fig:mem_model} shows an example \openshmem
memory layout, illustrating the location of remotely accessible symmetric
objects and private data objects.  As shown, symmetric data objects can be
located either in the symmetric heap or in the global/static memory section of
each \ac{PE}.

\subsection{Pointers to Symmetric Objects}

Symmetric data objects are referenced in \openshmem operations through the
local pointer to the desired remotely accessible object.  The address contained
in this pointer is referred to as a {\em symmetric address}.  Every symmetric
address is also a {\em local address} that is valid for direct memory access;
however, not all local addresses are symmetric.  Manipulation of symmetric
addresses passed to \openshmem routines, including pointer arithmetic;
structure or union member access; and array indexing are permitted as long as
the resulting local pointer remains within the same symmetric allocation or
object.  Symmetric addresses provided to typed and type-generic \openshmem
interfaces must be naturally aligned based on their type and any requirements
of the underlying architecture.  Symmetric addresses provided to sized
\openshmem interfaces must be aligned to the given size.  Symmetric addresses
are only valid at the \ac{PE} where they were generated; using a symmetric
address generated by a different \ac{PE} results in undefined behavior.

The \FUNC{shmem\_ptr} routine allows the programmer to query a {\em local
address} to a remotely accessible data object at a specified \ac{PE}.  The
resulting pointer is valid for direct memory access; however, providing this
address as an argument of an \openshmem routine that requires a symmetric
address results in undefined behavior.

\subsection{Atomicity Guarantees}\label{subsec:amo_guarantees}

\openshmem contains a number of routines that perform atomic operations on
symmetric data objects, which are defined in Section \ref{sec:amo}.
The atomic routines
guarantee that concurrent accesses by any of these routines to the same
location and using the same datatype (specified in Tables~\ref{stdamotypes} and
\ref{extamotypes}) will be exclusive.
Exclusivity is also guaranteed when the target \ac{PE} performs a wait or test
operation on the same location and with the same datatype as one or more atomic
operations.
\openshmem atomic operations do not guarantee exclusivity in the following
scenarios, all of which result in undefined behavior.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When concurrent accesses to the same location are performed using
        \openshmem atomic operations using different datatypes.
    \item When atomic and non-atomic \openshmem operations are used to access
        the same location concurrently.
    \item When \openshmem atomic operations and non-\openshmem operations (e.g.
        load and store operations) are used to access the same location
        concurrently.
\end{enumerate}
For example, during the execution of an atomic remote integer increment, i.e. \FUNC{shmem\_atomic\_inc},
operation on a symmetric variable \VAR{X}, no other \openshmem atomic operation
may access \VAR{X}.  After the increment, \VAR{X} will have increased its value
by \CONST{1} on the destination \ac{PE}, at which point other atomic operations
may then modify that \VAR{X}.  However, access to the symmetric object \VAR{X}
with non-atomic operations, such as one-sided \OPR{put} or \OPR{get} operations,
will invalidate the atomicity guarantees.

\cexample
    {The following \CorCpp example illustrates scenario 1.  In this example,
    different datatypes are used to access the same location concurrently,
    resulting in undefined behavior.  The undefined behavior can be resolved by
    using the same datatype in all concurrent operations.  For example, the
    32-bit value can be left-shifted and a 64-bit atomic OR operation can be
    used.}

\cexample
    {The following \CorCpp example illustrates scenario 2.  In this example,
    atomic increment operations are concurrent with a non-atomic reduction
    operation, resulting in undefined behavior.  The undefined behavior can be
    resolved by inserting a barrier operation before the reduction.  The
    barrier ensures that all local and remote AMOs have completed before the
    reduction operation accesses $x$.}

\cexample
    {The following \CorCpp example illustrates scenario 3.  In this example, an
    \openshmem atomic increment operation is concurrent with a local increment
    operation, resulting in undefined behavior.  The undefined behavior can be
    resolved by replacing the local increment operation with an \openshmem
    atomic increment.}
