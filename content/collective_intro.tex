\emph{Collective routines} are defined as communication or synchronization
operations on a group of \acp{PE} called an active set. The collective
routines require all \acp{PE} in the active set to simultaneously call the
routine.  A \ac{PE} that is not in the active set calling the collective
routine results in undefined behavior.  All collective routines have an
active set as an input parameter except \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all};
\FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all} must be called by all \acp{PE} of the
\openshmem program. 

The active set is defined by the arguments \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride},
and \VAR{PE\_size}.  \VAR{PE\_start} is the starting \ac{PE} number, a log (base
2) of \VAR{logPE\_stride} is the stride between \acp{PE}, and \VAR{PE\_size} is
the number of \acp{PE} participating in the active set.  All \acp{PE}
participating in the collective routine must provide the same values for these
arguments. 
 
Another argument important to collective routines is \VAR{pSync}, which is a
symmetric work array.  All \acp{PE} participating in a collective must pass the
same \VAR{pSync} array.  On completion of a collective call, the \VAR{pSync} is
restored to its original contents.  The user is permitted to reuse a \VAR{pSync}
array if all previous collective routines using the \VAR{pSync} array have been
completed by all participating \acp{PE}.  One can use a synchronization
collective routine such as \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} to ensure completion of previous collective
routines. The \FUNC{shmem\_barrier} routine allows the same \VAR{pSync} array to
be used on consecutive calls as long as the \acp{PE} in the active set do not change. 

All collective routines defined in the specification are blocking.  The
collective routines return on completion.  The collective routines defined in
the \openshmem specification are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_barrier\_all}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_barrier}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_broadcast\{32, 64\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_collect\{32, 64\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_fcollect\{32, 64\}}
\item Reductions for the following operations: AND, MAX, MIN, SUM, PROD, OR, XOR
\item \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall\{32, 64\}}
\item \FUNC{shmem\_alltoalls\{32, 64\}}
\end{itemize}
