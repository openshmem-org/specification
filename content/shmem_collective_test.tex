\apidescription{
    A call to \FUNC{shmem\_req\_test} returns immediately. If the
    collective operation identified by the request is completed, it returns
    true (non-negative integer). The request object is deallocated. If the collective operation is not
    completed, it returns zero. 

    In a multithreaded environment, the collective and the
    \FUNC{shmem\_req\_test} can be
    called by different threads. It is the responsibility of the \openshmem user
    to ensure that the \FUNC{shmem\_collective\_test} operation is called after the
    collective operation.

\apireturnvalues{
    On success returns zero or one, otherwise returns a negative integer.
