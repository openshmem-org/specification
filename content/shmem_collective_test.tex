\apidescription{
    A call to \FUNC{shmem\_req\_test} returns immediately. If the
    operation identified by the request is completed, it returns
    zero, and the request object is deallocated and cannot be reused.
    If the operation is not completed, it returns a non-negative integer. If
    the request object is not valid, behavior is undefined.

    In a multithreaded environment, \FUNC{shmem\_req\_test} can be called by
    different threads but on different request objects. It is the responsibility
    of the \openshmem user to ensure that proper synchronization is used to
    prevent race conditions or deadlock.
    }

\apireturnvalues{
    On success returns zero, otherwise returns a nonzero integer.
    }
