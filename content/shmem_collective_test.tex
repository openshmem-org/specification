\apidescription{
    A call to \FUNC{shmem\_req\_test} returns immediately. If the
    collective operation identified by the request is completed, it returns
    zero. The request object is deallocated. If the collective operation is not
    completed, it returns an integer (non-negative integer).

    In a multithreaded environment, the collective and the
    \FUNC{shmem\_req\_test} can be
    called by different threads. It is the responsibility of the \openshmem user
    to ensure that the \FUNC{shmem\_collective\_test} operation is called after the
    collective operation.

\apireturnvalues{
    On success returns zero or one, otherwise returns a negative integer.
