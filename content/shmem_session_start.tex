\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_session\_start} is a non-collective routine that begins a
    session on communication context \VAR{ctx} with hints requested via
    \VAR{options}.
    Sessions on a communication context must be stopped with a call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_session\_stop} on the same context.
    If a session is already started on a given context, another call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_session\_start} on that same context combines new options via a
    bitwise OR operation.
    If \VAR{ctx} compares equal to \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_CTX\_INVALID} then
    \FUNC{shmem\_session\_start} performs no action and returns immediately.

    No combination of \VAR{options} passed to \FUNC{shmem\_session\_start}
    results in undefined behavior, but some combinations may be detrimental for
    performance; for example, when selecting an option that is not applicable
    to the session. It is the user's responsibility to determine which
    combination of \VAR{options} benefits the performance of the session.

    The performance of \openshmem programs that issue many consecutive and
    small-sized communication routines might be improved by combining these
    routines into fewer operations.

    The \VAR{SHMEM\_SESSION\_CHAIN} hint indicates that a communication context
    will be used to issue a series of operations that are suitable for the
    \openshmem library to chain together.  An example of a
    chain is an iterative loop of non-blocking RMA and/or AMO routines. A chain
    must not include a memory ordering or collective operation.

    Because sessions do not affect the completion or ordering semantics of any
    \openshmem routines in the program, routines such as non-blocking RMAs,
    non-blocking AMOs, non-blocking \OPR{put-with-signals}, blocking scalar
    \OPR{puts}, small blocking \OPR{puts}, and blocking non-fetching AMOs are
    viable candidates for chaining.  Other routines, such as large blocking
    \OPR{puts}, all blocking \OPR{gets}, blocking fetching AMOs, and the memory
    ordering routines might require the library to enforce completions,
    reducing the potential benefit of chaining.

    The session will contain a chain (as defined by the
    \VAR{SHMEM\_SESSION\_CHAIN} option) of only AMOs that will not occur
    concurrently across any different signal operators
    (i.e.~\ref{subsec:signal_operator}), operations (\ref{sec:amo}), or types
    (Tables \ref{stdamotypes} and \ref{extamotypes}).

\apinotes{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_session\_start} routine provides hints for improving
    performance, and \openshmem implementations are not required to apply any
    optimization.
    \FUNC{shmem\_session\_start} is non-collective, so there is no implied
    synchronization.
