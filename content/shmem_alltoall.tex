\begin{apiarguments}

\apiargument{OUT}{dest}{A symmetric data object large enough to receive
    the combined total of \VAR{nelems} elements from each \ac{PE} in the
    active set.}
\apiargument{IN}{source}{A symmetric data object that contains \VAR{nelems}
    elements of data for each \ac{PE} in the active set, ordered according to
    destination \ac{PE}.}
\apiargument{IN}{nelems}{The number of elements to exchange for each \ac{PE}.
    \VAR{nelems} must be of type size\_t for \CorCpp.  When using
    \Fortran, it must be a default integer value.}
\apiargument{IN}{PE\_start}{The lowest \ac{PE} number of the active set of
    \acp{PE}.  \VAR{PE\_start} must be of type integer.  When using \Fortran,
    it must be a default integer value.}
\apiargument{IN}{logPE\_stride}{The log (base 2) of the stride between
    consecutive \ac{PE} numbers in the active set.  \VAR{logPE\_stride} must be of
    type integer.  When using \Fortran, it must be a default integer value.}
\apiargument{IN}{PE\_size}{The number of \acp{PE} in the active set.
    \VAR{PE\_size} must be of type integer.  When using \Fortran, it must
    be a default integer value.}
\apiargument{IN}{pSync}{A symmetric work array. In \CorCpp, \VAR{pSync} must be
    of type long and size \CONST{SHMEM\_ALLTOALL\_SYNC\_SIZE}. In \Fortran,
    \VAR{pSync} must be of type integer and size
    \CONST{SHMEM\_ALLTOALL\_SYNC\_SIZE}.  When using \Fortran, it must be a
    default integer value. Every element of this array must be initialized with
    the value \CONST{SHMEM\_SYNC\_VALUE} before any of the \acp{PE} in the
    active set enter the routine.}

\end{apiarguments}

\apidescription{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall} routines are collective routines. Each \ac{PE}
    in the active set exchanges \VAR{nelems} data elements of size
    32 bits (for \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall32}) or 64 bits (for \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall64})
    with all other \acp{PE} in the set. The data being sent and received are
    stored in a contiguous symmetric data object. The total size of each \acp{PE}
    \VAR{source} object and \VAR{dest} object is \VAR{nelems} times the size of
    an element (32 bits or 64 bits) times \VAR{PE\_size}.
    The \VAR{source} object contains \VAR{PE\_size} blocks of data (the size of each
    block defined by \VAR{nelems}) and each block of data is sent to a different \ac{PE}. 
    Given a \ac{PE} \VAR{i} that is the \kth PE in the active set and a \ac{PE}
    \VAR{j} that is the \lth \ac{PE} in the active set,
    \ac{PE} \VAR{i} sends the \lth block of its \VAR{source} object to
    the \kth block of
    the \VAR{dest} object of \ac{PE} \VAR{j}.

    As with all \openshmem collective routines, this routine assumes
    that only \acp{PE} in the active set call the routine.  If a \ac{PE} not
    in the active set calls an \openshmem collective routine, undefined
    behavior results.

    The values of arguments \VAR{nelems}, \VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{logPE\_stride},
    and \VAR{PE\_size} must be equal on all \acp{PE} in the active set. The same
    \VAR{dest} and \VAR{source} data objects, and the same \VAR{pSync} work
    array must be passed to all \acp{PE} in the active set.

    Before any \ac{PE} calls a \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall} routine, the following
    conditions must exist (synchronization via a barrier or some other method is
    often needed to ensure this): The \VAR{pSync} array on all \acp{PE} in the
    active set is not still in use from a prior call to a
    \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall/s} routine.  The \VAR{dest} data object on
    all \acp{PE} in the active set is ready to accept the
    \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall} data.

    Upon return from a \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall} routine, the following is true for
    the local PE: Its \VAR{dest} symmetric data object is completely updated and
    the data has been copied out of the \VAR{source} data object.
    The values in the \VAR{pSync} array are restored to the original values.
}

\apidesctable{
The  \dest{}  and \source{} data  objects must conform to certain typing
constraints, which are as follows:
}{Routine}{Data type of \VAR{dest} and \VAR{source}}

\apitablerow{shmem\_alltoall64}{\CONST{64} bits aligned.}
\apitablerow{shmem\_alltoall32}{\CONST{32} bits aligned.}

\apireturnvalues{
    None.
}

\apinotes{
    This routine restores \VAR{pSync} to its original contents.  Multiple calls
    to \openshmem\ routines that use the same \VAR{pSync} array do not require
    that \VAR{pSync} be reinitialized after the first call.
    The user must ensure that the \VAR{pSync} array is not being updated by any
    \ac{PE} in the active set while any of the \acp{PE} participates in
    processing of an \openshmem\ \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall} routine. Be careful to
    avoid these situations: If the \VAR{pSync} array is initialized at run time,
    some type of synchronization is needed to ensure that all \acp{PE} in the
    active set have initialized \VAR{pSync} before any of them enter an
    \openshmem\ routine called with the \VAR{pSync} synchronization array.  A
    \VAR{pSync} array may be reused on a subsequent \openshmem\
    \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall} routine only if none of the \acp{PE} in the
    active set are still processing a prior \openshmem\ \FUNC{shmem\_alltoall}
    routine call that used the same \VAR{pSync} array.  In general, this can be
    ensured only by doing some type of synchronization.
