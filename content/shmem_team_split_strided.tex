\apidescription{
The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_strided} routine is a collective routine.
It creates a new \openshmem team from a subset of the existing parent team,
where the \ac{PE} subset is defined by the triplet of arguments
(\VAR{PE\_start}, \VAR{PE\_stride}, \VAR{PE\_size}).
A valid triplet is one such that:
\begin{equation*}
  start + stride \cdot i \in \mathbb{Z}_N
  \hspace{0.35em}
  \forall
  \hspace{0.35em}
  i \in \mathbb{Z}_{size}
\end{equation*}
where $N$ is the number of \acp{PE} in the parent team.

This routine must be called by all \acp{PE} contained in the \ac{PE} triplet
specification. It may be called by additional \acp{PE} not included in the
triplet specification, but for those \acp{PE} a \VAR{new\_team} value of
\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID} is returned. All \acp{PE} must provide the
same values for the \ac{PE} triplet. This routine will return a \VAR{new\_team}
containing the \ac{PE} subset specified by the triplet and ordered by the
existing global \ac{PE} number.

The \VAR{config} argument specifies team configuration parameters, which are
described in Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_config_t}.

The \VAR{config\_mask} argument is a bitwise mask representing the set of
configuration parameters to use from \VAR{config}.
A \VAR{config\_mask} value of \CONST{0} indicates that the team
should be created with the default values for all configuration parameters.
See Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_config_t} for field mask names and
default configuration parameters.

When \VAR{parent\_team} specifies an invalid team, if \VAR{parent\_team}
compares equal to \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}, then no new team
will be created and \VAR{new\_team} will be assigned the value
\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

If an invalid \ac{PE} triplet is provided, then the \VAR{new\_team} will not be created.

If \VAR{new\_team} cannot be created, then it will be assigned the value
\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}.
}

\apireturnvalues{
  Zero on successful creation of \VAR{new\_team}, nonzero otherwise.
}

\apinotes{
  It is important to note the use of the less restrictive
  \VAR{PE\_stride} argument instead of \VAR{logPE\_stride}. This method of
  creating a team with an arbitrary set of \acp{PE} is inherently restricted
  by its parameters, but allows for many additional use-cases over using a
  \VAR{logPE\_stride} parameter, and may provide an easier transition for
  existing \openshmem programs to create and use \openshmem teams.

  See the description of team handles and predefined teams at the top of
  Section~\ref{subsec:team} for more information about semantics and usage.

    \Cstd[11] program. The program creates a new team of all even number
    \acp{PE} from the default team, then retrieves the \ac{PE} number and
