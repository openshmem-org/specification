\apidescription{
The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_strided} routine is a collective routine.
It creates a new \openshmem team from a subset of the existing parent team,
where the subset is defined by the \ac{PE} triplet (\VAR{PE\_start},
\VAR{PE\_stride}, and \VAR{PE\_size}) supplied to the routine.

This routine must be called by all processes contained in the \ac{PE} triplet
specification. It may be called by additional \acp{PE} not included in the
triplet specification, but for those processes a \VAR{new\_team} value of
\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID} is returned. All calling processes must provide the
same values for the \ac{PE} triplet. This routine will return a \VAR{new\_team}
containing the \ac{PE} subset specified by the triplet, and ordered by the
existing global \ac{PE} number. None of the parameters need to reside in
symmetric memory.

The \VAR{config} argument specifies team configuration parameters, which are
described in Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_config_t}.

The \VAR{config\_mask} argument is a bitwise mask representing the set of
configuration parameters to use from \VAR{config}.
A \VAR{config\_mask} value of \CONST{0} indicates that the team
should be created with the default values for all configuration parameters.
See Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_config_t} for field mask names and
default configuration parameters.

If \VAR{parent\_team} is an invalid team handle, the behavior is undefined.

If \VAR{parent\_team} compares equal to \LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}, then no
new team will be created, and  \VAR{new\_team} will be assigned the value
\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}.

If an invalid \ac{PE} triplet is provided, then the \VAR{new\_team} will not be created.

If \VAR{new\_team} cannot be created, then it will be assigned the value
\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_INVALID}.
}

\apireturnvalues{
  Zero on successful creation of \VAR{new\_team}, nonzero otherwise.
}

\apinotes{
  It is important to note the use of the less restrictive
  \VAR{PE\_stride} argument instead of \VAR{logPE\_stride}. This method of
  creating a team with an arbitrary set of \acp{PE} is inherently restricted
  by its parameters, but allows for many additional use-cases over using a
  \VAR{logPE\_stride} parameter, and may provide an easier transition for
  existing \openshmem programs to create and use \openshmem teams.

  See the description of team handles and predefined teams at the top of
  Section~\ref{subsec:team} for more information about semantics and usage.

    {The following example demonstrates the use of strided split in a
    \Cstd[11] program. The program creates a new team of all even number
    \acp{PE} from the default team, then retrieves the \ac{PE} number and
    team size on all \acp{PE} that are members of the new team.}
