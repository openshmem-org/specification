Here is a procedure to produce a diff of two versions (commits) of the spec.

For the old version
1) check out the commit of the old version
2) run the command (without quotes): 
    "latexpand --keep-comments --empty-comments main_spec.tex > flat_old.tex"
3) run the command (without quotes): 
    "de-macro flat_old.tex"

For the new version
4) check out the commit of the new version
5) run the command (without quotes): 
    "latexpand --keep-comments --empty-comments main_spec.tex > flat_new.tex"
6) run the command (without quotes): 
    "de-macro flat_new.tex"

Combine the two versions
7) run the command (without quotes): 
    "latexdiff flat_old-clean.tex flat_new-clean.tex > diff.tex"
8) at this point, can run "pdflatex diff.tex", but it will probably result in
    errors/complaints.  Edit the diff.tex to resolve these complaints from
    latex (read the text of the complaints).  Some examples might be:
    8a) around line 46 - should be something like: \usepackage{framed,color}
    8b) around line 5542 - remove illegal character
    8c) around line 1089 - should be something like: \usepackage[normalem]{ulem}
    8d) remove "uwave" and "sout" from DIFadd and DIFdel commands
9) run "pdflatex diff.tex" without errors, and get your diff.pdf.
